    FAQ:

    Question: Do you support a workers' revolution?
    Answer: No.
        I don't believe in revolution, and the reason is strictly pragmatic:
        Revolution is a good way to make a big fat mess of things.
        Rather, I believe in the slow and careful rethinking of things,
        with a focus on fiscal sustainability and an eye towards the long-term
        wealth generation.

    Question: Is American Alternative communism?
    Answer: No.
        Under American Alternative, the 'means of production' are not 
        owned by the state, nor are they owned communally.
        Rather, they are owned by an organization (specifically, a nonprofit),
        which bears the responsibility of tending them.  This is very
        similar (indeed, only slightly different from) the current organization
        of things, in which the means of production are owned by corporations.

        Anyway, I'm an anarchist, not a communist.

    Question: Then what's different?
    Answer: 
        Rather than seeking profits for shareholders, organizations under
        American Alternative seek to give away as much as possible. 
        They do so by systematically producing and gifting the goods 
        they produce to the people and organizations
        that need them.  This makes them valid targets for donations, be they 
        fiscal, material, or volunteerism.

        In short, rather than trying to sell things for the <em>most</em> possible,
        American Alternative organizations would try to sell things for the
        <em>least</em> amount possible.

    Question: Won't this stir a revolution?
    Answer: No.
        Imagine for a moment that the cost of Ramen Noodles dropped to zero,
        overnight.  What effect would that have?  Would people start hoarding
        noodles?  Sure, but only to an extent.  Ramen noodles, while perfectly
        capable of keeping an individual from starving, are not especially 
        desirable to eat, especially long-term.  No, the effect would be minor 
        at best.  This is the sort of change that American Alternative seeks to 
        catalyze.

    Question: What about cooperatives?
    Answer:
        A cooperatives is an organization owned by its members;
        this merely restructures the 

    Question: Isn't American Alternative a bit of a dream?
    Answer: Well, yes
        But this is a dream that has been broken down into manageable parts.

    Tools for organziations to use:
        Need some form of verification

        Phone apps: Jamboree - For organizing one-time work parties
                "What's old is new again"
                - Can reserve slots
                - Offers messaging between organizers and laborers,
                    - and among laborers
                - Verified / Unverified / Communal
                - Location-based / Map
                - Grind - for those looking for full-time employment
            MinPlenty
                - For tracking availability of goods
                - Both in stores and in production facilities?

    Should map out how an organization gets on its feet...
        Would make a nice article on AA website

    <h1>BONUS: Generalizing Open Source</h1>

    <p>
        As Steven Weber noted in <em>The Success of Open Source,</em>
        open-source is less a collection of software than a new, novel
        way of producing things.
        In this bonus material, I explore one possible method of
        generalizing it to non-software goods and services.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="gift-economies">
    <h2>Gift Economies</h2>

    <p>
        Open source is one example of a 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy">gift economy</a>&mdash;
        a way of producing things that relies upon giving the results
        away rather than charging for them.  
        Surprisingly, gift economies are fairly common, from an 
        anthropological point of view:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        One economy developed over and over by humans on every continent has 
        been the gift economy. In this system, if people have more than 
        they need of anything, they give it away. They don’t assign value, 
        they don’t count debts. Everything you don’t use personally can be 
        given as a gift to someone else, and by giving more gifts you 
        inspire more generosity and strengthen the friendships that keep 
        you swimming in gifts too. Many gift economies lasted for 
        thousands of years, and proved much more effective at enabling 
        all of the participants to meet their needs.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The question is, can we generalize open source's modus operandi,
        and if so, <em>how?</em>
        I believe the key lies in the 
        nonprofit <u>whose goal is to give away as much as possible.</u>
        Such nonprofits seem to me the appropriate device, for a few reasons.
    </p>

    <p>
        First, all open-source projects <em>are</em> nonprofits!  
        It's just that the cost of copying software is so low that few
        bother to formally announcing it.
        Second, a nonprofit with an ameniable goal is a natural target
        for volunteer efforts, both commercial and private.
        Such efforts are the backbone of open-source.
        Third, a collection of nonprofits is not too far removed from the current
        way of doing things&mdash; currently, corporations own everything,
        with shareholders taking a cut.
    </p>

    <h3>Reality Check</h3>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Transition, not revolution.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        For the foreseeable future, any project must be financially solvent
        to be viable, long-term.
        That is, our goal is to prosper <em>within</em> the 
        status quo&mdash; the capitalist, market economy&mdash; and not to 
        "revolutionize" anything.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>

        <p>
            It doesn't have to be cool; it doesn't have to be popular; 
            it doesn't have to be perfect; but, it does
            have to be financially solvent.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Open source has flourished in the hostile context of the market
        economy because copying software is very inexpensive.
        Since copying software costs next to nothing,
        the goods produced can be&mdash; and are&mdash; given away gratis.
        We should seek to extend this by giving away that which is already very cheap.

<div class="content" id="many-small-projects">
    <h2>Many Small Projects</h2>

    <p>
        It seems natural that our generalization of open source 
        be composed of many small projects, rather than a few large ones.
        The first good reason to avoid large projects is that
        one large, all-inclusive project would be a commune!
        Communism has been explored, and has failed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The second reason to prefer small projects 
        is to compartmentalize failure: The failure of one project need not
        adversely affect the whole.
        By stripping away that which does not work, what will be left will be
        a healthy economy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Third, all healthy economies support competition,
        and many small projects would foster competition more than
        a few large projects.
        That being said, scales of economy should be employed wherever possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm not talking about soup kitchens here.
        If somebody comes to me wanting headphones, I would tell them to 
        get started making headphones; and, that would constitute one
        project, among many projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will not attempt to describe the internal organization of 
        projects, being as the open-source landscape offers a great deal of
        diversity in this regard.
        It is only relevant to us outsiders what the project is producing
        (if anything).
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="success">
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0">Success in a Gifting Economy</h2>
    <h4>and Punishing Misbehavior</h4>

    <p>
        The key to success within a gifting economy lies in
        giving away goods and services which are desirable, and 
        relying on reciprocal gifts to make oneself wealthy.
        Thus, it is the prerogative of each project leader to determine what
        good or service to offer to maximize gifting to the project; 
        this is our take on "intrinsic value".
    </p>

    <p>
        A nonprofit with an amenable goal&mdash; and good execution&mdash;
        would attract both volunteer efforts and material donations.
        Through this mechanism, the nonprofit's operating costs 
        are driven downward, fostering its goal of giving away as 
        much as possible.
        In particular, it should be the goal of each project to attract and 
        support volunteerism, being as the greatest operating expense of any
        business is labor.
    </p>
 
    <p>
        Volunteer efforts could be part-time, full-time or one-time only;
        if open source is anything to go by, then we can expect that
        a given project to be manned by a relatively small group of core
        contributors, with the occasional helper stopping by.
        Note that the nonprofit structure does not exclude paying positions,
        so that specialists and laborer can be hired, as needed.
    </p>

    <p>
        To reiterate, the goal is not to get wealthy by having a 
        high-paying job, but by offering something that 
        attracts donations in the form of gifts.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Punishing Misbehavior</h3>

    <p>
        Naturally, the creator of each article is entitled to gift their goods
        to whomever they want&mdash; and to <em>decline</em> gifting
        for any reason whatsoever, including loss of trust.
        This forms the foundation of disciplinary action: 
        If we don't like you, we won't give to you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Truth be told, open-source does not bother with this form of
        disciplinary action: Things are simply given away for free,
        and anybody is welcome to take what they need.
        Such excommunication has the potential to form a motivating force 
        ("Well I had better get off my ass and do something").
    </p>

    <p>
        One good reason not to support a project is lack of transparency,
        especially, fiscal transparency.
        Public transparency builds trust with the community, offers a
        straightforward way to maintain accountability, and as a bonus,
        offers to let someone else handle the books.

        To simplify matters for the general public, there should exist a

<div class="content" id="why">
    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>
        I don't like the status quo! 
        It's full of idiots seeking status among other idiots, principally by
        way of conspicuous spending.
        It is not a sustainable way of life, and I belong to the generation
        that must weather the results of such unsustainability.
    </p>

    <p>
        On a deeper level, I am interested in 
        creating a society that can be trusted.
        For, I doubt that engineers, left to their own devices, would 
        create something as asinine as a pickup truck that destroys the planet.
        No, it's only within the context of profit-driven corporations
        and conspicuous spending that such a barbaric entity makes sense.
    </p>

    <p>
        I dream of an all-volunteer workforce,
        obtained through nonrevolutionary means,
        where everybody wins, and nobody works a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">bullshit job</a>.
        You don't have to make some useless widget, some fidget spinner,
        you can do things that are important!
    </p>

    <p>
        Like Richard Stallman, my principal aim is to prove that a
        different culture can succeed in a hostile environment.
        My hope is that by building on what we know, we can 
        usher in a sound, science-based, sustainable, and agreeable way of life.
        Naturally, the tenants of open-source will be
        taken advantage of wherever possible&mdash;
        e.g., open-source designs along with transparent and well-documented
        production methods.
