        As Steven Weber noted in <em>The Success of Open Source,</em>
        open-source is as much a new and novel way of producing things 
        as it is a collection of software.
        In this bonus material, I explore one possible method of
        generalizing its modus operandi to non-software goods.

    <h2>Gift Economies</h2>

    <p>
        Open source is one example of a 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy">gift economy</a>&mdash;
        a way of producing things that relies upon giving the results
        away rather than charging for them.<sup><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s06.html">[1]</a></sup>
        Gift economies are characterized by <em>not</em> placing value upon 
        goods and services rendered.
        Surprisingly, gift economies are fairly common, from an 
        anthropological point of view:
    </p>

    <blockquote> 
        One economy developed over and over by humans on every continent has 
        been the gift economy. In this system, if people have more than 
        they need of anything, they give it away. They don’t assign value, 
        they don’t count debts. Everything you don’t use personally can be 
        given as a gift to someone else, and by giving more gifts you 
        inspire more generosity and strengthen the friendships that keep 
        you swimming in gifts too. Many gift economies lasted for 
        thousands of years, and proved much more effective at enabling 
        all of the participants to meet their needs.<sup><a href="anarchy.works">[2]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Gift economies are an adaptation to abundance, rather than 
        scarcity.<sup><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s06.html">[1]</a></sup>
        The question is, can we generalize the open source way,
        and if so, <em>how?</em>
    </p>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            This is merely a business whose structure supports volunteerism.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        I believe the key lies in the 
        nonprofit <u>whose goal is to give away what it can.</u>
        The nonprofit seems to me the appropriate device, for a few reasons.
        First, all open-source projects <em>are</em> nonprofits!  
        It's just that few bother to formally announce it.
        Second, a nonprofit with an amenable purpose is a natural target
        for volunteer efforts, both commercial and private.
        Such non-paying efforts are the backbone of open-source.
        Third, a collection of nonprofits is realizable within 
        America today.
        In fact, it is not too far removed from the current
        way we do things. 
    </p>
   
    <h3>Reality Check</h3>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>

        <p>
            Transition, not revolution.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        For the foreseeable future, any project must be financially solvent
        to be viable, long-term.
        That is to say, our goal is to prosper <em>within</em> the 
        status quo&mdash; the capitalist / market economy&mdash; and not to 
        "revolutionize" anything.
    </p>

    <p>
        Open source has flourished in the hostile context of the market
        economy because copying software is very inexpensive.
        Since copying software costs essentially nothing,
        the goods produced can be&mdash; and are&mdash; given away gratis,
        forming the foundation of (monetarily) free software.
    </p>

    <p>
        In short, it doesn't have to be cool, it doesn't have to be popular,
        and it doesn't have to be perfect; but, it does
        have to be financially solvent.

<div class="content" id="many-small-projects">
    <h2>Many Small- / Medium-Sized Projects</h2>

    <p>
        It seems natural that our generalization of open source 
        be composed of many small projects, emulating the success of the 
        "bazaar" model. 
        The first good reason to avoid large projects is that
        one large, all-inclusive project would be a commune!
        Communism has been explored, and has consistently proved
        inferior to the market economy.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>

        <p>
            It should be a goal of every project to grow its own operation
            while demand remains unsatisfied; there is no contradiction in 
            a nonprofit doing so.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
        The second reason to prefer small projects 
        is to compartmentalize failure: The failure of one project need not
        adversely affect the whole.
        By stripping away that which does not work, what will be left will be
        a healthy economy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Third, all healthy economies support competition,
        and many small projects fosters competition more than
        a few large ones.
        That being said, scales of economy should be employed wherever possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will not attempt to describe the internal organization of 
        projects, being as the open-source landscape offers a great deal of
        diversity in this regard.
        It is only relevant to us outsiders what the project is producing,
        and what it is asking of us.

    <h2>Success in a Gifting Economy</h2>

    <p>
        A nonprofit with an amenable goal&mdash; and good execution&mdash;
        would attract both volunteer efforts and material donations.
        Through this mechanism, the organization's operating costs 
        are driven downward, fostering its goal of giving away what
        it can.
        Thus, it is the prerogative of the project's leaders to
        identify goods that other people would be willing to work for, while
        it is the prerogative of the individual to work for the goods they want.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            All successful non-profit projects would generate a community.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        In particular, each project should seek to attract and 
        support volunteer effort, being as the greatest operating expense of any
        business is labor.
    </p>

    <p>
        Volunteer efforts could be part-time, full-time or one-time only;
        if open source is anything to go by, then we can expect 
        a given project to be manned by a relatively small group of core
        participants, with the occasional helper stopping by.
        Note that the nonprofit structure does not exclude paying positions,
        so that specialists and laborer can be hired, as needed.
    </p>


    <p>
        With a common, shared goal&mdash; the project itself&mdash; the
        contributors to a project would form a community.
        Such communities would be the bread and butter of a successful
        gifting economy; without them, the whole edifice fails.
    </p>

    <h3>Individual Success in a Gift Economy</h3>
 
    <p>
        The key to success within our alternative economy lies
        in producing goods and services which 
        are desirable <em>to you.</em> 
        This is our take on "intrinsic motivation".
        The idea is that if you think they are valuable, then other people will
        as well, resulting in the creation of value within the whole.
        Gifting the products away motivates gifting towards the contributors
        of the product, which is our method of being paid off.
    </p>

    <p>
        To reiterate, the aim is not to get wealthy by having a 
        high-paying job, but by offering something that 
        justifies reciprocal donations.

    <h2>Bootstrapping a Gifting Economy</h2>

    <p>
        So how do we do it? 
    </p>

    <p>
        The long-term success of a project <em>is</em> its fiscal solvency,
        so make sure that each project stands on its own. 
        There is no contradiction in selling a product to 
        <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/20/libre_office_macos_fees/">some audience</a> 
        in order to give it away to another.
        Start small, with goods that are both needed and can be produced 
        in large quantities; improve designs and implementations slowly
        over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm not talking about soup kitchens here, and I'm not talking about
        picking up garbage from the side of the road.
        I'm talking about real, tangible goods with definite value for their
        recipients.
        If somebody comes to me wanting headphones, I would tell them to 
        get started making headphones&mdash; and that would constitute one
        project, among many projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        Such a project sounds impossible until you recognize that
        open-source can be used to our advantage&mdash; the
        project would <em>begin</em> with open-source designs, at which point
        a nonprofit could be set up to produce them. 
        Under the simple banner of <em>Free headphones</em>, the 
        manufacturing side of the project would attract volunteer efforts.
        Not all headphones produced can be given away; there will be some
        costs to be covered.  As such, <em>buying</em> a set of our headphones
        would be one way to support the organization, and the edifice as a whole.
    </p>

    <p>
        People are willing to work for things they want, when they want them:
        This, if anything, is the greatest lesson from open source.
        Volunteer efforts require that tools and materials be
        freely available, so give people the means to work for themselves,
        and they will, when they want to.  
        The key to doing so is the fiscally solvent nonprofit: The tools
        and materials are thus managed by the organization, with volunteer
        efforts welcomed but not necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
        Make the work a fun, social affair; there's no need to break our backs
        trying to be nice to one another.  Be nice to <em>yourself,</em>
        by creating things that you think have value.
        Seek to build a sense of community, both within projects and 
        among them.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="why">
    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>
        If I'm honest, the status quo scares me&mdash;
        people, all kinds of people, working on things they don't want&mdash;
        working <em>hard</em> on things they don't want&mdash;
        And doing so just to get by, just because they need the money...
        It is known that this is not sustainable: The "Human Activity" 
        that is destroying our planet is just a euphemism for work.
        Truth be told, working in America today is sort of a nightmare.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am interested in creating a society that can be trusted.
        For, I doubt that engineers, left to their own devices, would 
        create something as asinine as a pickup truck that destroys the planet.
        No, it's only within the context of profit-driven corporations
        and conspicuous spending that such barbaric entities exist.
    </p>

    <p>
        I dream of an all-volunteer workforce,
        obtained through non-revolutionary means,
        where everybody wins, and nobody works a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">bullshit job</a>.
        You don't have to file useless paperwork in some office building
        somewhere&mdash; you can build things that are important to you!
        And you can do so in a way that contributes to the happiness of 
        your fellow man!
    </p>

    <p>
        Like Richard Stallman, my principal aim is to prove that a
        different culture can succeed.
        My hope is that by building on what we know, we can 
        usher in a sound, science-based, sustainable, and agreeable way of life.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a society by us, for us; 
        our goal is to demonstrate that such a society is superior to
        the current way of doing things. 
        The way to do so is to gradually shift from the old way to the new way.
        Ideally, we would blur the line between "hobby" and "work", for
        the benefit of all&mdash; Notably, you don't have to volunteer 
        40 hours a week!

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>

        <p>
            Anyway, I'm an anarchist, not a communist.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Is this communism?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> No.
        Under this method, the "means of production" are not 
        owned by the state, nor are they owned communally.
        Rather, they are owned by an organization (specifically, a nonprofit),
        which bears the responsibility of tending them.  This is very
        similar (indeed, only slightly different from) the current organization
        of things (in which the "means of production" are owned by corporations).
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Then what's different?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b>
        Rather than seeking profits for shareholders, organizations
        would seek to give away as much as possible. 
        They do so by systematically producing and gifting the goods 
        they produce to the people and organizations
        that need them.  
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Do you support a workers' revolution?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> No.
        I don't believe in revolution, and the reason is strictly pragmatic:
        Revolution is a good way to make a big fat mess of things.
        Rather, I believe in the slow and careful rethinking of things,
        with a focus on sustainability and an eye towards long-term
        wealth generation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Won't this stir a revolution?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> No.
        Imagine for a moment that the cost of Ramen Noodles dropped to zero,
        overnight.  What effect would that have?  Would people start hoarding
        noodles?  Sure, but only to an extent.  Ramen noodles, while perfectly
        capable of keeping an individual from starving, are not especially 
        desirable to eat, especially long-term.  No, the effect would be minor 
        at best.  This is the sort of change that we seek to 
        catalyze.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> What about cooperatives?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b>
        A cooperative is an organization owned by its workers, and so 
        represents a restructuring of the ownership of the organization.
        Since the workers (whom are also the owners) seek their own best
        interests, it is not fundamentally different from corporate management,
        and thus not of interest to us.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Isn't this a bit of a dream?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> Well, yes...
        But it's a dream that has been broken down into manageable parts,
        and ought therefore be realizable.
