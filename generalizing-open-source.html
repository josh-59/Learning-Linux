title: "Generalizing Open Source"

<!--

    <p>
        That is to say, our goal is to prosper <em>within</em> the 
        status quo&mdash; the capitalist/market economy&mdash; and, 
		having succeeded within that context, prove ourselves superior.
    </p>


    <p>
        Probably strongest argument against generalizing open source is that
        free (gratis) software hinges upon the negligible cost of duplicating it.
        No doubt, a key to free software's success is the ease with which software 
        can be copied: It costs essentially nothing to duplicate one's efforts.
        That fact formed the context which has allowed a community to start, 
        to thrive, and ultimately, to meet its own needs.

	Motivation:
		A solution to climate change
			Less work
			Better, more repairable goods
			Power is in the hands of the giver
				Probably not going to produce F350's and hand
				them out to just anybody
		More ameniable to the average person
			Less work
			Work is characterized by "hobby projects"
			Income equality (roughly speaking)
		Implicit Meritocracy
			Those who have proved their trustworthiness are
			given greater power


  

Question: But I wouldn't build something for someone else to have it!
Response: Sure you would, if you wanted them to have it!  For instance, you'd
be very interested in building a factory promising to produce free solar panels.

    <h1>Generalizing Open Source</h1>

    <p>
        Within the context of software development, open collaboration has allowed 
		a community to start, thrive, and ultimately, to meet its own needs.
        A network of nonprofits is the vehicle
    </p>

<div class="content" id="gift-economies">
    <h2>Gift Economies</h2>

    <p>
        The open source community can be viewed as a  
        gift economy: It is characterized by giving things
		away rather than charging for them.
		By and large, nothing is expected in return for the labor put into
		free software.  Still, programmers have to eat, which is one
		reason that many projects are hobby projects.  
    </p>

	<p>
		In a capitalist society, to which we all belong, one says "Thank You" 
		with money.  If, for instance, your plumber did their job, you pay them, 
		and everyone walks away.  In a gift economy, one says "Thank You" by 
		giving back, by contributing in some way.
	</p>

	<p>
		We do not require everyone to be "on board" or to be contributors.  
		Our goal is our own satisfaction, not to be altruistic.  
	</p>

	<p>
		Note that for a gift economy to exist at all, property rights must 
		be preserved:  If it's not yours, after all, how can you give it away?  
		I bring this up because a defining feature of the communist ideal is 
		the absence of ownership, and I wish to make it clear that this is not 
		a pursuit of that ideal.  
	</p>

	<p>
		This is not socialism, either.  The open source ecosystem is a 
		characterized by loosely associated projects, with no central authority
		existing (or even desired).  
	<p>

	<p>
		This is different:  It is an attempt to extend what is known to work in
		some contexts to other contexts, where it has never been tried.  
        Like the open-source community, my overarching goal is a community 
		satisfying its own needs through mutual gifts.

<div class="content" id="nonprofits">
    <h2>Nonprofits</h2>
   
    <p>
        For generalizing the way open source works, I believe the appropriate vehicle 
        is the nonprofit organization.  
        Understand that a nonprofit is merely a business whose mission
		supports donations (both to the organization and by the organization) 
		and volunteerism.
		Contrast this with a corporation, whose mission (profit, typically for
		shareholders) renders donations and volunteerism 
		non-starters.
	</p>

	<p>
		A nonprofit is a "business" in the sense that it must remain cash-positive to 
		continue existing.  
		That is to say, a nonprofit organization that takes in less money 
		than it spends will cease to exist.
    </p>

	<p>
		The goal is this:  Create an organization with an ameneable goal,
		and offset costs by accepting material donations and volunteer efforts.

    <h2>Many Small and Medium-Sized Projects</h2>

    <p>
        This generalization of the open source method of production
        steers as far from communism
        (otherwise known as "Death by Beaurocracy") as possible.  
        Notably, it is (systemically) non-centrally planned, and
        nothing is owned by the state (or otherwise communally).  
        Rather, the motivation to start a project would come from the users
        (citizens) themselves, and would, generally, take the form of,
        "We ought to have _________."
    </p>

    <p> 
        My goal is to thrive within the current economy, and in virtue of that
        success to prove the method superior; my goal is not to forcibly reject 
        a way of life that, itself, works.
        For, I do not argue that the market economy 
    </p>

    <p>
        It seems natural that our generalization of open source should
        be composed of many small, independant, cooperating projects, 
        emulating the success of the 
        "bazaar" model of modern open-source. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The first good reason to avoid large projects is that
        one large, all-inclusive project would be a commune!
        Communism has been explored, and has consistently proved
        inferior to the market economy.
    </p>
   
    <p>
        The second reason to prefer small projects is
        to support competition;
        many small (read: competing) projects fosters competition more than
        a few large ones.
    </p>

    <p>
        Third, a cacophany of projects implicitly compartmentalizes failure.
        That is, the failure of one (smallish) project would not significantly
        affect the whole.
        By continually stripping away that which does not work (for whatever
        reason), what will be 
        left will be a healthy economy.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will not attempt to describe the internal organization of 
        projects, as there are many potentially successful organizations.
        To us outsiders of a given project, it is only relevant what 
        the project is producing, and what it is asking of us.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm not talking about soup kitchens here, and I'm not talking about
        picking up garbage from the side of the road.
        I'm talking about real, tangible goods with definite value for their
        recipients.
        People will be kept motivated by projects that they want to see succeed&mdash;
        things like, .
    </p>

    <p>
        People are willing to work for things they want, when they want them:
        This, if anything, is the greatest lesson from open source.
        Give people the means to work for themselves,
        and they will&mdash; when they want to.  

        The declaration of intent to start a new organization will probably
        be of the form, "The community ought to have xxxxxx."

    <h2>Reality Check(s)</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            This list should be exhaustive, so if you think you've got a 
            caveat or gotcha not listed here, email me!
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        If we extend open source's modality to non-software goods and services, 
        then we should expect all the caveats and gotcha's present in open source 
        to be present in our generalization as well.  
        Here we enumerate them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Open source software is consistently behind the cutting edge.  
        For example, we did not enter the Unix Wars except very late in the game,
        and even then our principal function was to "mop up", not to compete.
        As another example, while we will create a respectable phone operating 
        system (one day), we are already well behind the ball on the task.
        This is not anyone's fault, and I am not suggesting that we need a 
        phone operating system; I am only commenting on the state of things as 
        they stand.  A third example is that open-source does not produce 
        AAA-rated games.  
    </p>

    <p>
        This first caveat is worth pondering, for its implications.
        For example, it could easily be the case that you are gifted cloth,
        and be expected to sew clothing out of it.  Along the same lines, the 
        highly processed foods that are staples of the American diet will 
        either be forgotten entirely, or at least be absent for several years 
        after the start of this alternative.  It is my opinion that successfully
        extending open source's way of working will imply a substantial 
        technological step backward for its participants, at least initially; 
        that is not to say that it would be unliveable, and it is not to say 
        that it could not prove superior in the long term.
    </p>

    <p>
        A second caveat is a corollary to the first: Expect a long, protracted 
        era of, "It works, kind of...",
        In the case of a "free society", this would mean that the existant
        projects field a subsistence living for its participants,
        and not much more.  There is a substantial danger here, if the existant
        society does not field goods (e.g., tractors, computers) required for
        its prosperity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Usually reactionary, not "proactive".  
        A good capitalist goes out of their way to try to solve your 
        problems for you&mdash; and thereby sell you something new;
        there won't be that, save the community you belong to.

            Open source is an example of anarchy, not communism.
        </p>
    </div>

    What is your goal?  
    1) Extend/generalize it RESPONSIBLY
    2) Show/demonstrate an alternative is feasible
    3) Not play the blame game (or the "he said she said" game, for that matter.)
    4) Also, incidentally, not to ruin it by automating everything

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Is this communism?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> No.
        Under this method, the "means of production" are not 
        owned by the state, nor are they owned communally.
        Rather, they are owned by organizations (specifically, nonprofits),
        which bear the responsibility of tending them.  This is very
        similar (indeed, only slightly different from) the current organization
        of things (in which the "means of production" are owned and managed
        by corporations).
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Then what's different?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b>
        Rather than seeking profits, organizations
        would seek to give away as much as possible. 
        They do so by systematically producing and gifting goods 
        to the people and organizations that need them.  
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Do you support a workers' revolution?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> No.
        I don't believe in revolution, and the reason is strictly pragmatic:
        Revolution is a good way to make a big fat mess of things.
        Rather, I believe in the slow and careful rethinking of things,
        with a focus on sustainability and an eye towards long-term
        wealth generation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Won't this stir a revolution?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> No.
        Imagine for a moment that the cost of Ramen Noodles dropped to zero,
        overnight.  What effect would that have?  Would people start hoarding
        noodles?  Sure, but only to an extent.  Ramen noodles, while perfectly
        capable of keeping an individual from starving, are not especially 
        desirable to eat, especially long-term.  No, the effect would be minor 
        at best.  This is the sort of change that we seek to 
        catalyze.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> What about cooperatives?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b>
        A cooperative is an organization owned by its workers, and so 
        represents a restructuring of the ownership of the organization.
        Since the workers (whom are also the owners) seek their own best
        interests&mdash; in the form of profits&mdash; it is not fundamentally 
        different from corporate management, and thus not of interest to us.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Isn't this a bit of a dream?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> Well, yes...
        But it's a dream that has been broken down into manageable parts,
        and ought therefore be realizable.
