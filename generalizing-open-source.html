    <p>
        I don't believe in revolution, and the reason is strictly pragmatic:
        Revolution is a good way to make a big fat mess of things.
        Rather, I believe in the slow and careful rethinking of things,
        with a focus on fiscal sustainability and an eye towards the long-term
        wealth generation.

Imagine for a moment that the cost of Ramen Noodles dropped to zero,
overnight.  What effect would that have?  Would people start hoarding
Ramen noodles?  Yes, but only to an extent.  Ramen noodles, while perfectly
capable of keeping you from starving, are not especially desireable to
eat, especially long-term.  

No, the effect would be minor at best.

    <h1>BONUS: Generalizing Open Source</h1>

    <p>
        As Steven Weber noted in <em>The Success of Open Source,</em>
        open-source is less a collection of software than a new and novel
        way of producing things.
        In this bonus material, I explore one possible method of
        generalizing it to non-software goods and services.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="reality-check">
    <h2>Reality Check</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Transition, not revolution.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        For the foreseeable future, any project must be financially solvent
        to be viable, long-term.
        That is, our goal is to prosper <em>within</em> the 
        status quo&mdash; the capitalist, market economy&mdash; and not to 
        "revolutionize" the workplace.
    </p>

    <p>
        Open source has flourished because copying software is very inexpensive.
        Since copying software costs next to nothing,
        the goods produced can be&mdash; and are&mdash; given away gratis.
        The question is, can we generalize its modus operondi,
        and if so, <em>how?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        The key lies in the 
        nonprofit <u>whose goal is to give away as much as possible.</u>
        The nonprofit seems to me the appropriate device, for a few reasons:
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Supports Volunteerism</li>
                Is a natural target for volunteer efforts
            <li>Supports Gifting</li>
                Both to the project and from the project
            <li>Intrinsic Value</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Doesn't have to be cool, doesn't have to be popular, but it does
        have to be financially solvent.
        For example, there could be a nonprofit whose aim is to give 
        away as much housing as it can.
        Apartment buildings could be owned by this nonprofit, and
        this project would be led by someone.  
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="many-small-projects">
    <h2>Many Small Projects</h2>

    <p>
        It seems natural that our alternative to the market economy
        should be composed of many small projects,
        rather than few large ones.
        The first good reason to avoid large projects is that
        one large, all-inclusive project would be a commune!
        Communism has been explored and has failed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The second reason to prefer many small projects 
        is to compartmentalize failure: The failure of one project need not
        adversely affect the whole.
    </p>

    <p>
        Third, a healthy economy supports competition,
        and many small projects would foster competition more so than
        a few large projects.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="mutual-gifting">
    <h2>Mutual Gifting</h2>

    <p>
        The key to this theory is mutual gifting among projects.
        Rather than seeking profits, proprietors of nonprofits would seek
        wealth through the gifting from other projects.
        To do that, they must produce goods valuable enough
        to warrant the gifting.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            This is our take on "intrinsic value."
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Through this mechanism, the nonprofit's operating costs are driven downward,
        fostering its goal of giving away as much as possible.
    </p>
  
    <p>
        It should be the goal of each project to attract and support volunteerism,
    </p>

    <p>
        Reinforces the whole

        Naturally, the creator of each article is entitled to gift their goods
        to whomever they want&mdash; and to <em>decline</em> gifting
        for whatever reason whatsoever, including loss of trust.
    </p>

    <p>
        Transparency

    <p>
        "We are American Alternative"
        - Nonprofit organization
        - Goal is to give away as much as possible
        - Fiscally transparent
        - Is a valid target of gifting, both in terms of labor and materials
    </p>

    <p>
        "We support American Alternative"
        - Gives to an American Alternative organization (as above).
        - Is a valid target of gifting, both in terms of labor and materials.
    </p>
 
    <p>
        Viewed in the abstract, 
        each project makes a change: Be it from land into iron ore (as in a mine);
        or iron ore into steel (as in a foundry); or steel into consumer
        products (as in a factory).
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="why">
    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>
        I don't like the status quo! 
        It's full of idiots seeking status among other idiots, principally by
        way of conspicuous spending.
    </p>

    <p>
        On a deeper level, I am interested in 
        creating a society that can be trusted.
        For, I doubt that engineers, left to their own devices, would 
        create something as asinine as a pickup truck that destroys the planet.
        No, it's only within the context of greed and profit-driven corporations
        that such a barbaric entity makes sense.
    </p>

    <p>
        I dream of an all-volunteer workforce,
        obtained through nonrevolutionary means,
        where everybody wins, and nobody works a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">bullshit job</a>.
        I dream of sprawling, liveable, medium-density cities, built upon 
        sound, mixed-use zoning practices.
    </p>
 
    <p>
        Naturally, the tenents of open-source would be
        taken advantage of wherever possible&mdash;
        e.g., open-source designs along with transparent and well-documented
        production methods.
    </p>

    <p>
        Potentially, more material wealth for the average citizen
        Not that far-fetched.  I see a collection of open-source designs
        and production methods, and people volunteering to produce these
        things, for their own sake.
