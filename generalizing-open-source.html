    Nice, quiet night.  Peaceful, even.
    Sadly, this paper is still mediocre at best.  It is not up to my
    (admittedly high) standards.  The FAQ is a nice format; that should
    go up on AA's website, whenever it gets one.

    It's like the thought or idea has not yet been fully formed, in my
    mind.  
    Truly, the goal is to GENERALIZE open-source, not to dream up some
    new scheme.
    Hence, whatever I can take from 'How open source works' is exceptionally
    valuable.

    Getting there.  Slightly clearer idea of what it is I'm pursuing, now.

    It's interesting to note that we've been eating for thousands of years.
    Something so simple, yet, the means by which we've attained this end
    have changed, over and over and over.  

    So as it turns out, my gut was right: Modern open source is closer
    to anarchy than it is to other forms of organization.  
    My gut is often correct.

    So now I'm less *creating something new* than stitching together
    two ideas.

    
    FAQ:

    Question: Do you support a workers' revolution?
    Answer: No.
        I don't believe in revolution, and the reason is strictly pragmatic:
        Revolution is a good way to make a big fat mess of things.
        Rather, I believe in the slow and careful rethinking of things,
        with a focus on fiscal sustainability and an eye towards the long-term
        wealth generation.

    Question: Is American Alternative communism?
    Answer: No.
        Under American Alternative, the 'means of production' are not 
        owned by the state, nor are they owned communally.
        Rather, they are owned by an organization (specifically, a nonprofit),
        which bears the responsibility of tending them.  This is very
        similar (indeed, only slightly different from) the current organization
        of things, in which the means of production are owned by corporations.

        Anyway, I'm an anarchist, not a communist.

    Question: Then what's different?
    Answer: 
        Rather than seeking profits for shareholders, organizations under
        American Alternative seek the benefit of mankind. They do so by 
        actively gifting the goods they produce to the people and organizations
        that need them.  This makes them valid targets for donations, be they 
        fiscal, material, or volunteerism.

        In short, rather than trying to sell things for the <em>most</em> possible,
        American Alternative organizations would try to sell things for the
        <em>least</em> amount possible.

    Question: Won't this stir a revolution?
    Answer: No.
        Imagine for a moment that the cost of Ramen Noodles dropped to zero,
        overnight.  What effect would that have?  Would people start hoarding
        noodles?  Sure, but only to an extent.  Ramen noodles, while perfectly
        capable of keeping an individual from starving, are not especially 
        desirable to eat, especially long-term.  No, the effect would be minor 
        at best.  This is the sort of change that American Alternative seeks to 
        catalyze.

    Question: Isn't American Alternative a bit of a dream?
    Answer: Well, yes
        But this is a dream that has been broken down into manageable parts.

    <h1>BONUS: Generalizing Open Source</h1>

    <p>
        As Steven Weber noted in <em>The Success of Open Source,</em>
        open-source is less a collection of software than a new, novel
        way of producing things.
        In this bonus material, I explore one possible method of
        generalizing it to non-software goods and services.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="reality-check">
    <h2>Reality Check</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Transition, not revolution.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        For the foreseeable future, any project must be financially solvent
        to be viable, long-term.
        That is, our goal is to prosper <em>within</em> the 
        status quo&mdash; the capitalist, market economy&mdash; and not to 
        "revolutionize" the workplace.
    </p>

        <h4>Aside:</h4>

        <p>
            It doesn't have to be cool; it doesn't have to be popular; 
            it doesn't have to be perfect; but, it does
            have to be financially solvent.

        Open source has flourished in this context
        because copying software is very inexpensive.
        Since copying software costs next to nothing,
        the goods produced can be&mdash; and are&mdash; given away gratis.
        The question is, can we generalize its modus operandi,
        and if so, <em>how?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        I believe the key lies in the 
        nonprofit <u>whose goal is to give away as much as possible.</u>
        Such nonprofits seem to me the appropriate device, for a few reasons.
    </p>

    <p>
        First, all open-source projects <em>are</em> nonprofits!  
        It's just that the cost of copying software is so low that few
        bother to formally announcing it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Second, a nonprofit with an ameniable goal is a natural target
        for volunteer efforts, both commercial and private.
        For example, an automobile manufacturer might find it in their
        best interest to donate time and money to the development of 
        new tooling, and thereby support a project other than themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
        Third, a nonprofit is a natural target for volunteer effort,
        both the real and ideal backbone of open-source.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="many-small-projects">
    <h2>Many Small Projects</h2>

    <p>
        It seems natural that our generalization of open source 
        should be composed of many small projects, rather than a few large ones.
        The first good reason to avoid large projects is that
        one large, all-inclusive project would be a commune!
        Communism has been explored, and has failed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The second reason to prefer small projects 
        is to compartmentalize failure: The failure of one project need not
        adversely affect the whole.
        By stripping away that which does not work, what will be left will be
        a healthy economy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Third, a healthy economy supports competition,
        and many small projects would foster competition more so than
        a few large projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will not attempt to describe the internal organization of 
        projects, being as the open-source landscape offers a great deal of
        diversity in this regard.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="mutual-gifting">
    <h2>Mutual Gifting</h2>

    <p>
        The key to long-term wealth generation lies in the
        mutual gifting by projects, and among projects.
        By offering desirable goods or services, a nonprofit would
        attract both volunteer efforts and materiel donations.
        Through this mechanism, the nonprofit's operating costs are driven downward,
        fostering its goal of giving away as much as possible.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        One economy developed over and over by humans on every continent has 
        been the gift economy. In this system, if people have more than they 
        need of anything, they give it away. They don’t assign value, they 
        don’t count debts. Everything you don’t use personally can be given 
        as a gift to someone else, and by giving more gifts you inspire more 
        generosity and strengthen the friendships that keep you swimming in 
        gifts too. Many gift economies lasted for thousands of years, and 
        proved much more effective at enabling all of the participants to meet 
        their needs. Capitalism may have drastically increased productivity, 
        but to what end? On one side of your typical capitalist city someone 
        is starving to death while on the other side someone is eating caviar. 
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Thus, it is the prerogative of each project leader to determine what
        good or service to offer, to maximize gifting to the project; 
        this is our take on "intrinsic value".
        In particular, it should be the goal of each project to attract and 
        support volunteerism, being as the greatest operating expense of any
        business is labor.
    </p>
  
    <p>
        To reiterate, the
        goal is not to get rich by having a high-paying job, but to get
        wealthy by attracting donations in the form of gifts.

    <h2>Punishing Misbehavior</h2>

    <p>
        Naturally, the creator of each article is entitled to gift their goods
        to whomever they want&mdash; and to <em>decline</em> gifting
        for any reason whatsoever, including loss of trust.
        This forms the foundation of disciplinary action: 
        If we don't like you, we won't give to you.
    </p>

    <p>
        One good reason not to support a project is lack of transparency,
        especially, fiscal transparency.

        Thereby Accountability
        

        Let someone else handle the books.
    </p>

    <p>
        Such excommunication has the potential to form a motivating force 
        ("Well I had better get off my ass and do something").

<div class="content" id="american-alternative">
    <h2>American Alternative</h2>

    <p>
        To simplify matters for the general public, there should exist a 
        class of oversight organization, whose job it is to inspect and
        verify the validity of other organizations.
    </p>

    <p>
        "We are American Alternative"
        - Nonprofit organization
        - Goal is to give away as much as possible
        - Fiscally transparent
        - Is a valid target of gifting, both in terms of labor and materials
    </p>

    <p>
        "We support American Alternative"
        - Gives to an American Alternative organization (as above).
        - Is a valid target of gifting, both in terms of labor and materials.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="why">
    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>
        I don't like the status quo! 
        It's full of idiots seeking status among other idiots, principally by
        way of conspicuous spending.
    </p>

    <p>
        On a deeper level, I am interested in 
        creating a society that can be trusted.
        For, I doubt that engineers, left to their own devices, would 
        create something as asinine as a pickup truck that destroys the planet.
        No, it's only within the context of profit-driven corporations
        and conspicuous spending that such a barbaric entity makes sense.
    </p>

    <p>
        I dream of an all-volunteer workforce,
        obtained through nonrevolutionary means,
        where everybody wins, and nobody works a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">bullshit job</a>.
        You don't have to make some useless widget, some fidget spinner,
        you can do things that are important!
    </p>

    <p>
        Like Richard Stallman, my principal aim is to prove that a new, and 
        different, culture can succeed in a hostile environment.
        My hope is that by building on what we know, we can 
        usher in a sound, science-based, sustainable, and agreeable way of life.  
    </p>
 
    <p>
        Naturally, the tenents of open-source would be
        taken advantage of wherever possible&mdash;
        e.g., open-source designs along with transparent and well-documented
        production methods.
