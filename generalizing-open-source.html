August 2nd, 2022,

So, writing the first draft of this paper.  It's been a long time in the
making, and I guarantee the finished product will bear little to no 
resemblance to this draft; but, it's a start.  Gotta start somewhere.

Might write it as "BONUS: Generalizing Open Source

    <h1>BONUS: Generalizing Open Source</h1>

    <p>
        As _____ noted in <em>The Success of Open Source,</em>
        open-source is less a collection of software than a new and novel
        way of producing things.
        In *this* exciting conclusion, I present a (non-revolutionary,
        non-communist) theory of making the most of the
        open-source production method.

    <h2>Reality Check</h2>

    <p>
        For the foreseeable future, any project must be financially solvent
        to be viable, long-term.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus, our goal is to prosper <em>within</em> the 
        status quo, the market economy; no revolution required.

<div class="content" id="many-small-projects">
    <h2>Many Small Projects</h2>

    <p>
        One large project would be, after all, a commune.

    <p>
        Competing nonprofits

    <h2>Punishing Misbehavior</h2>

    <p>
        The creator of each article is entitled to gift their crap
        to whomever they want&mdash; and to <em>decline</em> gifting
        for whatever reason whatsoever, including loss of trust.
    </p>

    <p>
        Transparency

    <h2>Why</h2>

    <p>
        To create a society that can be trusted.
    </p>

    <p>
        Doubt engineers, left to their own devices, would create something
        as asinine as a pickup truck that destroys the planet.
    </p>

    <p>
        End of bullshit jobs,
        a return to a principally industrial economy,
        Potentially, more material wealth for the average citizen
    </p>

    <p>
        Implicit support of fewer working hours
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's figure this out!
