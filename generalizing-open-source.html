    Find the motivation first- e.g., It is in my best interest that
    other people have solar panels on their roofs. Ergo, I should
    make (and give away) solar panels.
    
    Volunteer efforts implies that one cannot command.

    The nonprofit organization has two main advantages over the for-profit
    organization.  First, it is a valid target for volunteer efforts, upon
    which the entire success of the edifice depends.  Even if a for-profit
    business has an ameniable mission, like Subaru and handicapped dogs or
    Bogo socks whom gift socks to the homeless, these entities are not
    valid targets for volunteer effort.

    The second, and arguably more important advantage, is that the
    not-for-profit structure allows the organization to focus on the
    products produced per se, rather than focusing on turning a profit
    on the product.
    Laundry soap that is distributed in bulk is one good example: The
    resulting product is cogent in a wholistic sense in a way that
    for-profit products can never be. 

    Besides, this is an answer to overabundance, whereas capitalism is
    a strategy for dealing with scarcity.  Moreover, it is not the case
    that capitalism is without corruption.

    

    <p>
        I'm not talking about soup kitchens here, and I'm not talking about
        picking up garbage from the side of the road.
        I'm talking about real, tangible goods with definite value for their
        recipients.
    </p>

        People, in turn, will be kept motivated by projects that they want.

        People are willing to work for things they want, when they want them:
        This, if anything, is the greatest lesson from open source.
        Give people the means to work for themselves,
        and they will&mdash; when they want to.  


    <p>
        If somebody comes to me wanting headphones, I would tell them to 
        get started making headphones&mdash; and that would constitute one
        project, among many projects.
        Such a project sounds impossible until you realize that
        open-source can be used to our advantage&mdash; the
        project would <em>begin</em> with open-source designs, at which point
        a nonprofit could be set up to produce them. 
        Under the simple banner of <em>Free headphones</em>, the 
        manufacturing side of the project would attract volunteer efforts.
        Not all headphones produced can be given away; there will be some
        costs to be covered.  As such, <em>buying</em> a set of our headphones
        would be one way to support the organization, and the edifice as a whole.

October 1st,
START SMALL. Build into the required demand. That will be the trick to
bootstrapping it: Small projects that help each other subsist, 

Question: But I wouldn't build something for someone else to have it!
Response: You would if you wanted them to have it-  For instance, you'd
be very interested in building a factory promising to produce free headphones.

        As Steven Weber noted in <em>The Success of Open Source,</em>
        open-source is as much a new and novel way of producing things 
        as it is a collection of software.
        In this bonus material, I explore one possible method of
        generalizing its modus operandi to non-software goods.

    <h2>Gift Economies</h2>

    <p>
        Open source is one example of a 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy">gift economy</a>&mdash;
        a way of producing things that relies upon giving the results
        away rather than charging for them.<sup><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s06.html">[1]</a><a href="https://abahlali.org/files/Graeber.pdf" title="p39">[2]</a></sup>
        Gift economies are characterized by <em>not</em> placing value upon 
        goods and services rendered.
        Surprisingly, gift economies are fairly common, from an 
        anthropological point of view:
    </p>

    <blockquote> 
        One economy developed over and over by humans on every continent has 
        been the gift economy. In this system, if people have more than 
        they need of anything, they give it away. They don’t assign value, 
        they don’t count debts. Everything you don’t use personally can be 
        given as a gift to someone else, and by giving more gifts you 
        inspire more generosity and strengthen the friendships that keep 
        you swimming in gifts too. Many gift economies lasted for 
        thousands of years, and proved much more effective at enabling 
        all of the participants to meet their needs.<sup><a href="anarchy.works">[3]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Gift economies are an adaptation to abundance, rather than 
        scarcity.<sup><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s06.html">[1]</a></sup>
        The question is, can we generalize the open source way,
        and if so, <em>how?</em>
    </p>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            This is merely a business whose structure supports volunteerism.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        I believe the key lies in the 
        nonprofit <u>whose goal is to give away what it can.</u>
        The nonprofit seems to me the appropriate device, for a few reasons.
        First, all open-source projects <em>are</em> nonprofits!  
        It's just that few bother to formally announce it.
        Second, a nonprofit with an amenable purpose is a natural target
        for volunteer efforts, both commercial and private.
        Such non-paying efforts are the backbone of open-source.
        Third, a collection of nonprofits is realizable within 
        America today&mdash;
        In fact, it is not too far removed from the current
        way we do things. 
    </p>
   
    <h3>Reality Check</h3>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>

        <p>
            Transition, not revolution.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        For the foreseeable future, any project must be financially solvent
        to be viable, long-term.
        That is to say, our goal is to prosper <em>within</em> the 
        status quo&mdash; the capitalist / market economy&mdash; and not to 
        "revolutionize" anything.
    </p>

    <p>
        Open source has flourished in the hostile context of the market
        economy because copying software is very inexpensive.
        Since copying software costs essentially nothing,
        the goods produced can be&mdash; and are&mdash; given away gratis,
        forming the foundation of (monetarily) free software.
    </p>

    <p>
        In short, it doesn't have to be cool, it doesn't have to be popular,
        and it doesn't have to be perfect; but, it does
        have to be financially solvent.

<div class="content" id="many-small-projects">
    <h2>Many Small- / Medium-Sized Projects</h2>

    <p>
        It seems natural that our generalization of open source 
        be composed of many small projects, emulating the success of the 
        "bazaar" model of modern open-source. 
        The first good reason to avoid large projects is that
        one large, all-inclusive project would be a commune!
        Communism has been explored, and has consistently proved
        inferior to the market economy.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>

        <p>
            It should be a goal of every project to grow its own operation
            while demand remains unsatisfied; there is no contradiction in 
            a nonprofit doing so.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
        The second reason to prefer small projects 
        is to compartmentalize failure: The failure of one project need not
        adversely affect the whole.
        By stripping away that which does not work, what will be left will be
        a healthy economy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Third, all healthy economies support competition,
        and many small projects fosters competition more than
        a few large ones.
        That being said, scales of economy should be employed wherever possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will not attempt to describe the internal organization of 
        projects, being as the open-source landscape offers a great deal of
        diversity in this regard.
        It is only relevant to us outsiders what the project is producing,
        and what it is asking of us.

    <h2>Success in a Gifting Economy</h2>

    <p>
        A nonprofit with an amenable goal&mdash; and good execution&mdash;
        attracts both volunteer efforts and material donations.
        Through this mechanism, the organization's operating costs 
        are driven downward, fostering its goal of giving away what
        it can.
        Thus, it is the prerogative of the project's leaders to
        identify goods that other people would be willing to work for, while
        it is the prerogative of the individual to work for the goods they want.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            All successful non-profit projects would generate a community.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        In particular, each project should seek to attract and 
        support volunteer effort, being as the greatest operating expense of any
        business is labor.
    </p>

    <p>
        Volunteer efforts could be part-time, full-time or one-time only;
        if open source is anything to go by, then we can expect 
        a given project to be manned by a relatively small group of core
        participants, with the occasional helper stopping by.
        Note that the nonprofit structure does not exclude paying positions,
        so that specialists and laborer can be hired, as needed.
    </p>


    <p>
        With a common, shared goal&mdash; the project itself&mdash; the
        contributors to a project would form a community.
        Such communities would be the bread and butter of a successful
        gifting economy; without them, the whole edifice fails.
    </p>

    <h3>Individual Success in a Gift Economy</h3>
 
    <p>
        The key to success within our alternative economy lies
        in producing goods and services which 
        are desirable <em>to you.</em> 
        This is our take on "intrinsic motivation".
        The idea is that if you think they are valuable, then other people will
        as well, resulting in the creation of value within the whole.
        Gifting the products away motivates gifting towards the contributors
        of the product, which is our method of being paid off.
    </p>

    <p>
        To reiterate, the aim is not to get wealthy by having a 
        high-paying job, but by offering something that 
        justifies reciprocal donations.
    </p>

    <h2>Bootstrapping a Gifting Economy</h2>

    <p>
        So how do we do it? 
    </p>

    <p>
        Just like a business, every nonprofit requires a plan.
        The long-term success of a project <em>is</em> its fiscal solvency,
        so make sure each project stands on its own.  
        There is no contradiction in selling a product to 
        <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/20/libre_office_macos_fees/">some audience</a> 
        in order to give it away to another.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first priority should be food, especially, staples:

        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Beans</li>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Wheat</li>
            <li>Etc..</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        To implement this, two projects can be started:
        One nonprofit to own and manage the farmland, and one (or more) 
        others to farm it. 
        Land not used by any nonprofit can be leased out to local 
        farmers&mdash; this is already industry-standard practice.
    </p>

    <p>
        The resulting products should be given away as each nonprofit can 
        sustain it:

        <ul>
            <li>To those who show up and help out first</li>
            <li>To those who donate second</li>
            <li>To those in the vicinity third</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Farming is labor-intensive for perhaps three months out of the year,
        and our second priority should be housing.
        We can expect workers to be motivated for such buildings, so that
        they can be built by volunteer efforts.
        Again, the nonprofits responsible for housing should take care to 
        remain fiscally solvent, and gift with discretion.
    </p>

    <p>
        The third priority must be a means of getting around.
        There's no reason a nonprofit could not own buses to move people
        to and from their worksites.
        At the personal level, though, I do not expect privately owned vehicles
        (meaning cars and trucks) to be commonplace&mdash;
        Rather, I expect the bicycle to be the main way of getting around.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>

        <p>
            To make use of volunteer efforts, materials must always be 
            available.
            At the lowest level, this means land must be owned by 
            nonprofit organizations for exploitation.
        </p>
    </div>


    <p>
        If you had these three things, you would be giving people the
        oportunity to volunteer. 
        If you then made tools and materials available, people could
        build what they want.
        Although it may seem trivial, we can rely upon the wants and needs
        of the public to dictate what projects are worth pursuing, 
        for the motivation to work will only come from 
        the people themselves.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>

        <p>
            It is the responsibility of the nonprofit to organize
            said tools and materials.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        I fully expect there to be hardships as this alternative economy
        gets on its feet&mdash; Things like substandard housing, 
        boring diets, a lack of videogames to play, lack of heat, etc.
        are to be expected.
        But these things can be overcome, and I fully expect the result to prove
        superior&mdash; more sustainable, less alienating, less dependant upon
        constant growth&mdash; than the status quo.
    </p>

    <p>
        Communication is key, and there should exist some means of 
        organizing labor&mdash; Ideally, an app.
        Every nonprofit should be very vocal about what it's
        doing, what it needs, and in inviting people to participate in its mission.
        Make the work a fun, social affair; I would love to see a 
        6-hour/day, 4-day/week workweek become standard!

    </ul>
</div>

<div class="content" id="why">
    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>
        Because the open-source way has produced better products the
        proprietary method of development.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe it's crazy.  Maybe it's stupid&mdash; People don't <em>buy</em>
        things they don't want, after all.
        But maybe there are others that feel the same way I do&mdash; that 
        our collective pursuit of profit has resulted in unsustainable,
        unsatisfying lives.
    </p>

    <p>
        As David Graeber wrote, 
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "There is a way out, which is to accept that
        anarchist forms of organization would not look
        anything like a state. That they would involve an
        endless variety of communities, associations,
        networks, projects, on every conceivable scale, overlapping 
        and intersecting in any way we could imagine,
        and possibly many that we can’t. Some would be quite
        local, others global. Perhaps all they would have in
        common is that none would involve anyone showing
        up with weapons and telling everyone else to shut up
        and do what they were told. And that, since anarchists
        are not actually trying to seize power within any
        national territory, the process of one system replacing
        the other will not take the form of some sudden 
        revolutionary cataclysm&mdash; the storming of a Bastille, the
        seizing of a Winter Palace&mdash; but will necessarily be
        gradual, the creation of alternative forms of organization 
        on a world scale, new forms of communication,
        new, less alienated ways of organizing life, which will,
        eventually, make currently existing forms of power
        seem stupid and beside the point. That in turn would
        mean that there are endless examples of viable anarchism: 
        pretty much any form of organization would
        count as one, so long as it was not imposed by some
        higher authority, from a klezmer band to the 
        international postal service."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        In the future I see, your life will not be defined by the kind of
        work you do.  You'll work, sure, when the need arises or the inclination
        strikes you.  But not eight hours a day, and not forty hours a week.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe you'll assemble bicycles at the local bike shop.  
        Maybe you'll harvest apples from the local trees.
        Maybe you'll attend some lectures at the local university.
        Maybe you'll mow the grass or just play with your kids.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your life will be yours to live as you see fit, not bound by the
        pursuit of money, and not bound to please corporate overlords.  
        I dream of an all-volunteer workforce, obtained through 
        non-revolutionary means, where everybody wins, and nobody works a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">bullshit job</a>.
        You don't have to file useless paperwork in some office building
        somewhere&mdash; you can build things that matter to you!
        And you can do so in a way that contributes to the happiness of 
        your fellow man!
    </p>

    <p>
        Since our goal is to give stuff away, and not to turn a profit on it, 
        what will result is a profound re-thinking of the society we all
        take for granted.
        Consider, for example, laundry soap.  It would naturally be
        distributed in bulk (i.e., palletized containers), and left to
        the consumer to fill their own container from it.  
        This eliminates the single-use plastic 
        associated with laundry detergent today. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In other words, the seemingly innocuous change of working for products
        <em>per se</em> naturally leads to less work, greater efficiency and
        increased sustainability. 
        In this way, I am interested in creating a society that can be trusted.
        For, I doubt that engineers, left to their own devices, would 
        create something as asinine as a pickup truck that destroys the planet.
        No, it's only within the context of profit-driven corporations
        and conspicuous spending that such barbaric entities exist.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a society by us, for us; 
        our goal is to demonstrate that such a society is superior to
        the current way of doing things. 
        The way to do so is to gradually shift from the old way to the new way.
        Ideally, we would blur the line between "hobby" and "work", for
        the benefit of all&mdash; Notably, you don't have to volunteer 
        40 hours a week!

            Anyway, I'm an anarchist, not a communist.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Is this communism?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> No.
        Under this method, the "means of production" are not 
        owned by the state, nor are they owned communally.
        Rather, they are owned by organizations (specifically, nonprofits),
        which bear the responsibility of tending them.  This is very
        similar (indeed, only slightly different from) the current organization
        of things (in which "means of production" are owned by corporations).
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Then what's different?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b>
        Rather than seeking profits for shareholders, organizations
        would seek to give away as much as possible. 
        They do so by systematically producing and gifting goods 
        to the people and organizations that need them.  
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Do you support a workers' revolution?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> No.
        I don't believe in revolution, and the reason is strictly pragmatic:
        Revolution is a good way to make a big fat mess of things.
        Rather, I believe in the slow and careful rethinking of things,
        with a focus on sustainability and an eye towards long-term
        wealth generation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Won't this stir a revolution?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> No.
        Imagine for a moment that the cost of Ramen Noodles dropped to zero,
        overnight.  What effect would that have?  Would people start hoarding
        noodles?  Sure, but only to an extent.  Ramen noodles, while perfectly
        capable of keeping an individual from starving, are not especially 
        desirable to eat, especially long-term.  No, the effect would be minor 
        at best.  This is the sort of change that we seek to 
        catalyze.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> What about cooperatives?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b>
        A cooperative is an organization owned by its workers, and so 
        represents a restructuring of the ownership of the organization.
        Since the workers (whom are also the owners) seek their own best
        interests, it is not fundamentally different from corporate management,
        and thus not of interest to us.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Isn't this a bit of a dream?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> Well, yes...
        But it's a dream that has been broken down into manageable parts,
        and ought therefore be realizable.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> When?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> 
        When members of the public are motivated to do it.
        This motivation must be felt, rather than speculated about.
