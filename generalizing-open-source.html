        organization is producing, and the motivation to start each 
        nonprofit is want of the same; that is to say, the existence of each 
        organization is a reflection of desire within the community for what that 
        organization produces.  
    </p>


    <p>
        Whereas a capitalist sets a price, 
        simply doesn't.
        Often, because someone else has


Question: But I wouldn't build something for someone else to have it!
Response: Why not?  You would if you wanted them to have it!  For instance, you'd
be very interested in building a factory promising to produce free solar panels.

    <p>
        Our second priority should be housing.
        We can expect workers to be motivated for such buildings, so that
        they can be built by volunteer efforts.
        Again, the nonprofits responsible for housing should take care to 
        remain fiscally solvent, and gift with discretion.
    </p>

    <p>
        The third priority must be a means of getting around.
        While a nonprofit organization could own buses to move people
        to and from their worksites, I expect the primary means of transportation
        (at the personal level) to be the bicycle.
        Thus, I envision sprawling cities based around fiscally sound 
        <a href="https://sustainablecitycode.org/brief/mixed-use-zoning/">mixed use</a> 
        zoning practices.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you had these three things, you would be giving people the
        opportunity to volunteer. 
        If you then made tools and materials available, people could
        build what they want.
        Although it may seem trivial, we can rely upon the wants 
        of the public to dictate what projects are worth pursuing, 
        for the motivation to work will only come from 
        the people themselves.

    <h1>Extending Open Source</h1>

    <p>
        Within the context of software development,
        open collaboration has allowed a community to start, 
        thrive, and ultimately, to meet its own needs.

        Goal is a community characterized
        by mutual gift exchange, satisfying its own needs.

        A network of nonprofits is the vehicle
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="gift-economies">
    <h2>Gift Economies</h2>

    <p>
        Open collaboration on software has indirectly produced a 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy">gift economy</a>&mdash;
        a method of exchange that relies upon giving things
        away rather than charging for them.<sup><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s06.html">[1]</a><a href="https://abahlali.org/files/Graeber.pdf" title="p39">[2]</a></sup>
        Surprisingly, gift economies are fairly common, from an 
        anthropological point of view:
    </p>

    <blockquote> 
        One economy developed over and over by humans on every continent has 
        been the gift economy. In this system, if people have more than 
        they need of anything, they give it away. They don’t assign value, 
        they don’t count debts. Everything you don’t use personally can be 
        given as a gift to someone else, and by giving more gifts you 
        inspire more generosity and strengthen the friendships that keep 
        you swimming in gifts too. Many gift economies lasted for 
        thousands of years, and proved much more effective at enabling 
        all of the participants to meet their needs.<sup><a href="anarchy.works">[3]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        In the broadest possible strokes, capitalism is a cultural adaptation
        to scarcity, whereas gift economies are an adaptation to abundance. 
        Notably, gift economies are not built upon the expectation of repayment;
        there is no guilt associated with, nor any debt incurred, in taking
        and using a product of a gift economy.
    </p>

    <p>
        the question is, Can we generalize the way it works, and if so, how?
        Probably strongest argument against generalizing open source is that
        free (gratis) software hinges upon the negligible cost of duplicating it.
        No doubt, a key to free software's success is the ease with which software 
        can be copied: It costs essentially nothing to duplicate one's efforts.
        That fact formed the context which has allowed a community to start, 
        to thrive, and ultimately, to meet its own needs.
    </p>

    <p>
        In practice, after all, the user is not expected to copy and redistribute
        a given work.  For all my love of Linux Mint, I have yet to give anybody
        a copy of it!  


        Another strong argument against generalizing the way that it works is
        that open source hinges upon the collaboration of an extremely small subset
        of users&mdash; developers.

        Ownership in open source: Right to impose change.

    <h2>Reality Check(s)</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            This list should be exhaustive, so if you think you've got a 
            caveat or gotcha not listed here, email me!
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        If we extend open source's modality to non-software goods and services, 
        then we should expect all the caveats and gotcha's present in open source 
        to be present in our generalization as well.  
        Here we enumerate them.
    </p>

        Software is unique in that copying, and therefore distributing,
        the fruits of one's labor incurs no expense whatsoever;



    <p>
        Open source software is consistently behind the cutting edge.  
        For example, we did not enter the Unix Wars except very late in the game,
        and even then our principal function was to "mop up", not to compete.
        As another example, while we will create a respectable phone operating 
        system (one day), we are already well behind the ball on the task.
        This is not anyone's fault, and I am not suggesting that we need a 
        phone operating system; I am only commenting on the state of things as 
        they stand.  A third example is that open-source does not produce 
        AAA games.  While open source games exist (and are often very good&mdash;
        see Balanced Annihilation, for example), they consistently fail to 
        realize what modern computers are capable of.  But hey: You don't need
        the latest graphics to have fun!  
    </p>

    <p>
        This first caveat is worth pondering, for its implications.
        For example, it could easily be the case that you are gifted cloth,
        and be expected to sew clothing out of it.  Along the same lines, the 
        highly processed foods that are staples of the American diet will 
        either be forgotten entirely, or at least be absent for several years 
        after the start of this alternative.  It is my opinion that successfully
        extending open source's way of working will imply a substantial 
        technological step backward for its participants, at least initially; 
        that is not to say that it would be unliveable, and it is not to say 
        that it could not prove superior in the long term.
    </p>

    <p>
        A second caveat is a corollary to the first: Expect a long, protracted 
        era of, "It works, kind of...",
        In the case of a "free society", this would mean that the existant
        projects field a subsistence living for its participants,
        and not much more.  There is a substantial danger here, if the existant
        society does not field goods (e.g., tractors, computers) required for
        its prosperity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Usually reactionary, not "proactive".  
        A good capitalist goes out of their way to try to solve your 
        problems for you&mdash; and thereby sell you something new;
        there won't be that, save the community you belong to.  
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="nonprofits">
    <h2>Nonprofits</h2>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            The nonprofit is merely a business whose structure supports volunteerism
            and mutual gift exchange.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        For generalizing the open source way, I think the appropriate vehicle 
        is the nonprofit organization.  I have a few reasons.
        First, all open-source projects are nonprofits!  
        It's just that only the largest feel the need to formally organize as such.
        Second, a nonprofit with an amenable purpose is a natural target
        for volunteer efforts, both commercial and private.
        These non-paying (or more accurately, indirectly paying) efforts are the 
        backbone of the open-source ecosystem.
        Third, a collection of nonprofits is realizable within 
        America today&mdash;
        In fact, it is not too far removed from the way things are done 
        currently.
    </p>

    <p>
        The nonprofit structure is not a magical cure-all entity. 
        It is just a particular kind of business: One in which the proprieter 
        (starter) does not lay claim to the organization's profits, should they
        exist.
        Moreover, like any other business, it must remain profitable
        ("financially solvent") to remain in existence.  Stated another way,
        If an organization takes in less money than it spends, it will cease to 
        exist.  Take heed, for this is the only "rule" I have yet found!  
    </p>

    <p>
        A nonprofit with an amenable goal (and good execution)
        will attract both volunteer efforts and material donations.
        Volunteer efforts could be part-time, full-time or one-time only;
        If open source is anything to go by, then a given project will
        probably be manned by a relatively small group of core
        participants, with the occasional helper stopping by.
    </p>

    <p>
        Like any other business, every nonprofit needs a plan.
        The long-term success of a project <em>is</em> its fiscal solvency,
        so each project must stand on its own.  
    </p>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>
            The nonprofit structure does not exclude the possibility of 
            paying positions, so specialists and laborers can be hired as needed.
        </p>
    </div>


    <p>
        In particular, for the foreseeable future, any project must be 
        financially solvent to be viable, long-term.
        That is to say, our goal is to prosper <em>within</em> the 
        status quo&mdash; the capitalist/market economy&mdash; and thereby
        prove ourselves superior.

    <h2>Many Small and Medium-Sized Projects</h2>

    <p>
        This generalization of the open source method of production
        steers as far from communism
        (otherwise known as "Death by Beaurocracy") as possible.  
        Notably, it is (systemically) non-centrally planned, and
        nothing is owned by the state (or otherwise communally).  
        Rather, the motivation to start a project would come from the users
        (citizens) themselves, and would, generally, take the form of,
        "We ought to have _________."
    </p>

    <p> 
        My goal is to thrive within the current economy, and in virtue of that
        success to prove the method superior; my goal is not to forcibly reject 
        a way of life that, itself, works.
        For, I do not argue that the market economy 
    </p>

    <p>
        It seems natural that our generalization of open source should
        be composed of many small, independant, cooperating projects, 
        emulating the success of the 
        "bazaar" model of modern open-source. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The first good reason to avoid large projects is that
        one large, all-inclusive project would be a commune!
        Communism has been explored, and has consistently proved
        inferior to the market economy.
    </p>
   
    <p>
        The second reason to prefer small projects is
        to support competition;
        many small (read: competing) projects fosters competition more than
        a few large ones.
    </p>

    <p>
        Third, a cacophany of projects implicitly compartmentalizes failure.
        That is, the failure of one (smallish) project would not significantly
        affect the whole.
        By continually stripping away that which does not work (for whatever
        reason), what will be 
        left will be a healthy economy.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will not attempt to describe the internal organization of 
        projects, as there are many potentially successful organizations.
        To us outsiders of a given project, it is only relevant what 
        the project is producing, and what it is asking of us.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm not talking about soup kitchens here, and I'm not talking about
        picking up garbage from the side of the road.
        I'm talking about real, tangible goods with definite value for their
        recipients.
        People will be kept motivated by projects that they want to see succeed&mdash;
        things like, .
    </p>

    <p>
        People are willing to work for things they want, when they want them:
        This, if anything, is the greatest lesson from open source.
        Give people the means to work for themselves,
        and they will&mdash; when they want to.  

        The declaration of intent to start a new organization will probably
        be of the form, "The community ought to have xxxxxx."

            Open source is an example of anarchy, not communism.
        </p>
    </div>

    What is your goal?  
    1) Extend/generalize it RESPONSIBLY
    2) Show/demonstrate an alternative is feasible
    3) Not play the blame game (or the "he said she said" game, for that matter.)
    4) Also, incidentally, not to ruin it by automating everything

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Is this communism?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> No.
        Under this method, the "means of production" are not 
        owned by the state, nor are they owned communally.
        Rather, they are owned by organizations (specifically, nonprofits),
        which bear the responsibility of tending them.  This is very
        similar (indeed, only slightly different from) the current organization
        of things (in which the "means of production" are owned and managed
        by corporations).
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Then what's different?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b>
        Rather than seeking profits, organizations
        would seek to give away as much as possible. 
        They do so by systematically producing and gifting goods 
        to the people and organizations that need them.  
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Do you support a workers' revolution?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> No.
        I don't believe in revolution, and the reason is strictly pragmatic:
        Revolution is a good way to make a big fat mess of things.
        Rather, I believe in the slow and careful rethinking of things,
        with a focus on sustainability and an eye towards long-term
        wealth generation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Won't this stir a revolution?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> No.
        Imagine for a moment that the cost of Ramen Noodles dropped to zero,
        overnight.  What effect would that have?  Would people start hoarding
        noodles?  Sure, but only to an extent.  Ramen noodles, while perfectly
        capable of keeping an individual from starving, are not especially 
        desirable to eat, especially long-term.  No, the effect would be minor 
        at best.  This is the sort of change that we seek to 
        catalyze.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> What about cooperatives?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b>
        A cooperative is an organization owned by its workers, and so 
        represents a restructuring of the ownership of the organization.
        Since the workers (whom are also the owners) seek their own best
        interests&mdash; in the form of profits&mdash; it is not fundamentally 
        different from corporate management, and thus not of interest to us.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> Isn't this a bit of a dream?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> Well, yes...
        But it's a dream that has been broken down into manageable parts,
        and ought therefore be realizable.
