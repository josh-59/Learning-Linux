    <h2>Learning Linux How-to</h2>
    <h4>Under Construction!</h4>

    <p>
        Learning GNU/Linux is not necessarily easy.
        Although there exists many sources of documentation, they are not,
        in general, well-organized, so that searching for the right source can be hard.
        This paper aims to give an overview of available resources,
        some useful pointers for each, and links, as appropriate.

    <h2>How-to</h2>

    <p>
        Steps:

        <ol>
            <li>
                <i>Figure out what your question is.</i>
                <p>
                    This can be more difficult than you might guess, because you might
                    honestly not know how to phrase your question.
                    Be specific!
                    Things are very well-defined in computers, and this stands in great
                    contrast to an intuitive idea of their operation.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <i>How you can get an answer to it? </i>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is an appropriate source?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Man pages </li>
                        <li> Official Documentation </li>
                        <li> Unofficial Documentation </li>
                        <li> Application's Manual </li>
                        <li> Internet Search / Stack Overflow</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Do you need more information than that? Or maybe less?</li>
                    <li>Would an example be helpful?</li>

                </ul>
            </li>

                <li> <i>Find good sources to answer that question. </i>
                    <li>Do you need more specific information?  Or more general information?</li>
                </li>

        <div id="man-pages" class="content">
            <h2> Man Pages </h2>
            <p>
                By far the most useful asset in the Linux documentation chain is the
                manual ("man") pages.
                They are concise, immediately available,
                and generally answer as many questions as possible in as short a space
                as possible.
                They often include examples, hints, and useful suggestions
                (such as <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getdents.2.html">"These are not the interfaces you are intered in."</a>).
            </p>

            <p>
                They are accessed at the command line so:
            </p>

            <div class="code">
                man app
            </div>

            <p>
                A bit of history:  The man pages
                <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html"> date back to the first implementations of Unix</a>,
                where they were the primary documentation for command-line operations.
                They often included practical notes such as known bugs (and some still do).
                The structure of the manual is worth learning, as well as the
                structure of any given page.
                For instance, the manual is divided into sections (<tt>man man</tt> for more information),
                and within pages, the command syntax specification is a minor language of its own.
                It's often helpful to look at the "See Also" section just to figure out what's available.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can search through available man pages with the <tt>apropos</tt> command,
                as in,
            </p>

            <div class="code">
                apropos decompress
            </div>

            <p>
                Technically speaking, this utility searches the single-line, "short description"
                of each man page, and prints out the names and descriptions of programs that match your search
                (<tt>man apropos</tt> for more information).
            </p>

            <p>
                Once within the <tt>man</tt> utility, you can search the current page
                by typing a forward slash, then your search term:
            </p>

            <div class="code">
                /&lt;search-term&gt;
            </div>

            <p>
                Then type a single <b>n</b> to jump to the next result.
                Many of the controls of the man-pages coincide with those of
                the <tt>less</tt> paging utility, and with those of the <tt>vi/vim</tt>
                text editor, so they're worth learning.
                For instance, move down the page one line by typing <b>j</b>.
                Move up the page one line by typing <b>k</b>.
                And, move down a screenful by hitting the spacebar.
            </p>
