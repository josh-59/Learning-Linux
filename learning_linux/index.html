    <h1>Learning Linux </h1>
    <h4>A Tour Through Documentation</h4>

    <p>
        Linux is a very large subject.
        Although there are many sources of documentation, they are not,
        in general, well-organized, so that finding the right information
        can be hard.
        This paper aims to give an overview of available resources,
        some examples of each, and useful pointers, where appropriate.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="how-to" class="content">
    <h2>How-to</h2>
    <p>
        It's one of the great failings of modern computer culture to
        suggest that being new or trying to learn is embarassing.
    </p>

    <ol class="big-list">
        <li>
            <i>Figure out what your question is.</i>
            <p>
                This can be more difficult than you might guess, because you might
                honestly not know how to phrase your question.
                Be specific!
                Things are very well-defined in computers.
                This stands in great
                contrast to intuitive conceptions of their operation.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <i>What would answer your question?  </i>
            <ul style="list-style-type: '- '">
                <li> An Example </li>
                <li> A Precise, Detailed Explanation</li>
                <li> A Description </li>
                <li> Theoretical Comprehension </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>Revise.</i>
            <p>
                Do you need more information? Or less?  You might
                be searching for something
                practically useful rather than
                theoretically exact.
                Conversely, you might find that your practical knowledge is
                lacking some kind of <i>body</i>; in this case, you are
                looking to frame your knowledge in appropriate theory.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div id="man-pages" class="content">
    <h2> Man Pages </h2>
    <p>
        By far the most useful asset in the Linux documentation chain is the
        manual ("man") pages.
        They are concise, immediate,
        and generally aim to answer as many questions as quickly as possible.
        They often include examples, hints, and useful suggestions
        (such as <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getdents.2.html">"These are not the interfaces you are intered in."</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
        They are accessed at the command line so:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        man app
    </div>

    <p>
        You can search through available man pages with the <code>apropos</code> command,
        as in,
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        apropos decompress
    </div>

    <p>
        Technically speaking, this utility searches the single-line, "short description"
        of each man page, and prints out the names and descriptions of programs that match your search
        (<code>man apropos</code> for more information).
    </p>

    <p>
        Once within the <code>man</code> utility, you can search the current page
        by typing a forward slash, then your search term:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        /&lt;search-term&gt;
    </div>

    <p>
        Then type a single <b>n</b> to jump to the next result.
        Many of the controls of the man-pages coincide with those of
        the <code>less</code> paging utility, and with those of the <code>vi/vim</code>
        text editor, so they're worth learning.
        For instance, move down the page one line by typing <b>j</b>.
        Move up the page one line by typing <b>k</b>.
        And, move down a screenful by hitting the spacebar.
    </p>

    <div class="aside_right">
        <h4>Manual Sections:</h4>
        <ol style="margin-left:0">
            <li> Shell Commands </li>
            <li> Systems Calls </li>
            <li> C Library Functions </li>
            <li> Special Files </li>
            <li> File Formats and Conventions </li>
            <li> Games </li>
            <li> Miscellaneous</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p>
        Man pages date back to the first implementations of Unix,<sup><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup>
        where they were the user's primary documentation of the newly-minted Unix operating system.
        They are filled with useful notes, but tend to be more "handy" than
        "exhaustive," and often refer the reader to external documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The structure of the manual is worth learning.
        For instance, just by the location of a page within the manual, one
        can tell if it's a program that can be called from the command-line,
        a system call, or a C library function;
        <code>man man</code> for more information.
        Similarly, the structure of the man-pages themselves is worth learning.
        For instance, each page has has a "See Also" section near the bottom,
        which is useful for finding out what else is available.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="official-documentation" class="content">
    <h2> Official Documentation </h2>

    <p>
        Official documentation
        originates from the group or organization that is producing
        the work.
        It is suitably positioned to be both exhaustive and authoritative over the subject at hand.
        Think of offical documentation like the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source"> primary sources </a>
        from history class.
        This is by far my favorite form of documentation&mdash;
        Nothing makes me feel warmer and fuzzier than downloading
        the <i>Official ________ _________ Reference Manual</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, it's unreasonable to expect people to produce
        such technically meritorious documentation in multiple formats simultaneously, such as
        HTML, PDF, etc. (although GNU does an admirable job).
        As a consequence, official documentation
        is typically found in web-page format (and is often
        community-driven).
    </p>

    <p>
        Several awesome examples spring to mind:
    </p>
    <ul class="big-list">
        <li>
            <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">
                The Rust Progamming Language</a>&mdash;
                Written by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols with updates from the community,
                this book is the main documentation of the Rust language.
                I think it's a great book, especially for its
                technical excellence.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://godotengine.org/">
                    Godot Open Source Game Engine</a>&mdash;
                    Godot is an MIT-licensed open source game engine (and, I daresay, the one you're looking for).
                    <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/">Its official documentation</a> is community-driven.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html"> GNU's official documentation</a> is
                    both superemely authoritative and technically exhaustive.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/"> Arch Linux's Wiki</a> is great,
                    and almost always applies to distributions outside of Arch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">Mozilla's HTML Docs</a>&mdash;
                    Mozilla helps to define
                    the HTML living standard,<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup> and hence, represents an official voice with respect to modern HTML.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="unofficial-documentation" class="content">
            <h2> Unofficial Documentation </h2>

            <p>
                Most documenation is from unofficial, secondary sources.
                Examples include this website, websites like it, books that are
                <i>about</i> without being authoritative (which is most of them),
                Youtube videos, podcasts etc..
                Unofficial documentation is hit-or-miss, and whether it
                represents a hit for you is largely a matter of taste.
                Think of them like commentary of the subject at hand.
            </p>

            <p>
                Examples of good, unofficial documentation:
                <ul class="big-list">
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://tldp.org/"> The Linux Documentation Project</a>&mdash; Sadly, this project is not maintained anymore.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        by Bruce Molay&mdash;
                        Personal favorite.  It walks the reader through the structure of Linux via programming tutorials.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Honestly, the biggest problem with this sort of documentation
                is that there's just too much of it.
                As my professor said, "There are a gazzillion books on Linux."
                Moreover, the above sources (and the many like them) are not necessarily authoritative.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="theory" class="content">
            <h2> Theory </h2>
            <p>
                I put "theory" into its own category in order to avoid discussions
                about "university" (which deal primarily in theory).
                Theory is worth studying insofar as it yields practical insight
                (or entertainment).
                I like studying languages and mathematics, myself.

                    This.  Probably the best form of unofficial documentation
                    is the tutorial, because it is informative, concise, and relevant.
