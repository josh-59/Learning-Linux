    <h1>Learning Linux How-to</h1>
    <h4>Under Construction!</h4>

    <p>
        Learning GNU/Linux is not necessarily easy.
        Although there exists many sources of documentation, they are not,
        in general, well-organized, so that searching for the right source can be hard.
        This paper aims to give an overview of available resources,
        some useful pointers for each, and links, as appropriate.
    </p>

</div>

<div id="how-to" class="content">
    <h2>How-to</h2>

    <p>
        Steps:

        <ol>
            <li>
                <i>Figure out what your question is.</i>
                <p>
                    This can be more difficult than you might guess, because you might
                    honestly not know how to phrase your question.
                    Be specific!
                    Things are very well-defined in computers, and this stands in great
                    contrast to an intuitive idea of their operation.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <i>How you can get an answer to it? </i>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is an appropriate source?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Man pages </li>
                        <li> Official Documentation </li>
                        <li> Unofficial Documentation </li>
                        <li> Application's Manual </li>
                        <li> Internet Search / Stack Overflow</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Do you need more information than that? Or maybe less?</li>
                    <li>Would an example be helpful?</li>

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li> <i>Find good sources to answer that question. </i>
                <li>Do you need more specific information?  Or more general information?</li>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div id="man-pages" class="content">
        <h2> Man Pages </h2>
        <p>
            By far the most useful asset in the Linux documentation chain is the
            manual ("man") pages.
            They are concise, immediately available,
            and generally answer as many questions as possible in as short a space
            as possible.
            They often include examples, hints, and useful suggestions
            (such as <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getdents.2.html">"These are not the interfaces you are intered in."</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
            They are accessed at the command line so:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            man app
        </div>

        <p>
            A bit of history:  The man pages
            <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html"> date back to the first implementations of Unix</a>,
            where they were the primary manual for the newly-minted Unix operating system.
            They often included practical notes such as known bugs.
            The structure of the manual is worth learning, as well as the
            structure of any given page.
            For instance, the manual is divided into sections (<tt>man man</tt> for more information),
            and within pages, the command syntax specification is a minor language of its own.
            It's often helpful to look at the "See Also" section just to figure out what's available.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can search through available man pages with the <tt>apropos</tt> command,
            as in,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            apropos decompress
        </div>

        <p>
            Technically speaking, this utility searches the single-line, "short description"
            of each man page, and prints out the names and descriptions of programs that match your search
            (<tt>man apropos</tt> for more information).
        </p>

        <p>
            Once within the <tt>man</tt> utility, you can search the current page
            by typing a forward slash, then your search term:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            /&lt;search-term&gt;
        </div>

        <p>
            Then type a single <b>n</b> to jump to the next result.
            Many of the controls of the man-pages coincide with those of
            the <tt>less</tt> paging utility, and with those of the <tt>vi/vim</tt>
            text editor, so they're worth learning.
            For instance, move down the page one line by typing <b>j</b>.
            Move up the page one line by typing <b>k</b>.
            And, move down a screenful by hitting the spacebar.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="official-documentation" class="content">
        <h2> Official Documentation </h2>

        <p>
            Official documentation
            originates from the group or organization that is producing
            the work, and is uniquely positioned to be authoritative over the subject at hand.
            Think of offical documentation like the
            <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source"> primary sources </a></i>
            from history class.
            This is by far my favorite form of documentation&mdash;
            Nothing makes me feel warmer and fuzzier than downloading
            the <i>Official ______ _______ Reference Manual</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, it's unreasonable to expect people to produce
            such technically meritorious documentation in multiple formats simultaneously, such as
            HTML, PDF, etc. (although GNU does an admirable job).
            As a consequence, the best official documentation
            is typically found in web-page format (and is often
            community-driven).
        </p>

        <p>
            Several awesome examples spring to mind:
            <ul class="big-list">
                <li>
                    <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">

                    Written by two authors and updated from the community,
                    this book is the main documentation of the Rust language.
                    I think it's a great book, especially for its
                    technical excellence.

    <div id="unofficial-documentation" class="content">
        <h2> Unofficial Documentation </h2>

        <p>
            Most documenation is from unofficial, secondary sources.
            Examples include this website, websites like it, books that are
            <i>about</i> without being authoritative (which is most of them),
            Youtube videos, etc..
            Unofficial documentation is hit-or-miss, and whether it
            represents a hit for you is largely a matter of taste.
            Think of them like commentary of the subject at hand.
        </p>

        <p>
            Examples of good, unofficial documentation:
            <ul class="big-list">
                <li>
                    <a href="http://tldp.org/"> The Linux Documentation Project</a>&mdash; Sadly, this project is not maintained anymore
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php"> The Linux Command Line</a>&mdash; An Introduction to Linux; Good, but not to my taste
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            These sources (and the many like them) are not necessarily authoritative.
            They are often more beginner-friendly than official documentation.
        </p>

    </div>



    <div id="videos" class="content">
        <h2> Videos </h2>

        <p>
            A form of unofficial documenation; videos, also, are relatively hit-or-miss.
            It's very difficult
            to produce an <i>entertaining</i> video that also provides
            serious content.  That is, videos are difficult to do, if your
            aim is to describe the underlying theory without generating
            a lecture.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cool Videos:
            <ul>
