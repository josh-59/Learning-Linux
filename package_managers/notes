"""
    The apt command is a high-level commandline interface for package management.
    It is basically a wrapper of apt-get, apt-cache and similar commands,
    originally intended as an end-user interface and enables some options
    better suited for interactive usage by default.
    apt provides a friendly progress bar when installing packages using apt install.
    apt will remove cached .deb packages by default after sucessful installation of downloaded packages.

    Users are recommended to use the new apt(8) command for
    interactive usage and use the apt-get(8) and apt-cache(8) commands in the shell script.

Don't like:
apt search golang -> Returns over 1000 results; can't locate compiler;                      "76,000?  Those are rookie numbers."
    github repositories on Debian packages?
    Poor solution: Detracts from usability of command-line package management
    Also, is this even checked?

    Also, Go has it's own package manager, "go-get".
