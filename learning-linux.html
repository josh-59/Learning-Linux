		Linux is a very large subject.
		Although there are many sources of documentation, they are not,
		in general, well-organized, so that finding the right information
		can be hard.
		This paper aims to give an overview of available resources,
		some examples of each, and useful pointers, where appropriate.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="how-to" class="content">
	<h2>How-to</h2>

	<ol class="big-list">
		<li>
			<i>Figure out what your question is.</i>
			<p>
				This can be more difficult than you might guess, because you might
				honestly not know how to phrase your question.
				Be specific!
				Things are very well-defined in computers.
				This makes computers unique.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<i>What would answer your question?  </i>
			<ul style="list-style-type: '- '">
				<li> An Example </li>
				<li> A Precise Explanation</li>
				<li> A Detailed Description </li>
				<li> Theoretical Discussion </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Revise.</i>
			<p>
				Do you need more information? Or less?
				You might need something immediately
				useful rather than theoretically correct.
				Conversely, you might find that your practical knowledge is
				lacking some kind of <i>body</i>; in this case, you are
				looking to frame your knowledge in appropriate theory.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Be Patient.</i>
			<p>
				Skill accrues.
				Answer one question at a time.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<div id="man-pages" class="content">
	<h2> Man Pages </h2>
	<p>
		By far the most useful asset in the Linux documentation pool is the
		manual ("man") pages.
		Man pages date back to the first implementations of Unix,<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html">[1]</a></sup>
		where they were the user's primary documentation of the newly-minted operating system.
		They often included examples, hints and useful suggestions, such as,
		<a href="http://man.cat-v.org/unix-1st/1/cat">"<em>cat file</em> is about the easiest way to print a file."</a>
	</p>

	<p>
		Today, the man pages are <a href="http://www.man7.org/">maintained by Michael Kerrisk,</a>
		and often include examples, hints, and useful suggestions,
		such as, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getdents.2.html">"These are not the interfaces you are interested in.</a>"
		Learn to use man pages early, for they are a way of life.
	</p>

	<div class="aside-right" style="margin-left: 25pt; padding-bottom: 0">
		<h4>Manual Sections:</h4>
		<ol style="margin-left:0">
			<li> Shell Commands </li>
			<li> Systems Calls </li>
			<li> C Library Functions </li>
			<li> Special Files </li>
			<li> File Formats and Conventions </li>
			<li> Games </li>
			<li> Miscellaneous</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<p>
		Man pages are accessed at the command line so:
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		man app
	</div>

	<p>
		You can search through available man pages with the <code>apropos</code> command,
		as in,
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		apropos decompress
	</div>

	<p>
		or
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		apropos extract
	</div>

	<p>
		Technically speaking, this utility searches the single-line, "short description"
		of each man page, and prints out the names and descriptions of programs that match your search
		(<code>man apropos</code> for more information).
	</p>

	<p>
		Once within the <code>man</code> utility, you can easily search the content
		by typing a forward slash, then your search term:
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		/&lt;search-term&gt;
	</div>

	<p>
		Then, <em>enter</em>.  To jump to the next result, type a single <b>n</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Many of the controls of the man-pages coincide with those of
		the <code>less</code> paging utility, and the <code>vim</code>
		text editor, so they're worth learning.
		For instance, to move down one line, type <b>j</b>.
		To move up one line, type <b>k</b>.
		And, move down a screenful by hitting the spacebar.
		Why the crazy controls?  It keeps your fingers on the home row.
	</p>

	<p>
		The manual is structured into sections, as given above.
		In particular, Section 1 contains entries for user commands,
		such as <code>cat</code>, <code>man</code>, <code>mv</code> and <code>cp</code>,
		while Section 3 contains the manual pages for C library functions, such as
		<code>getline()</code>, <code>printf()</code> and <code>strtol()</code>.
		When using <code>apropos</code>, one can restrict the search to a particular section with the <code>-s</code> switch:
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		apropos -s 3 printf
	</div>

	<p>
		Otherwise, <code>apropos</code> lists them all.
	</p>

	<p>
		In addition, each manual page is organized into
		a common format.
		For instance, each page has a "See Also" section near the bottom,
		which lists related commands/library functions.
	</p>

<div id="official-documentation" class="content">
	<h2> Official Documentation </h2>

	<p>
		Official documentation originates from the group or organization
		that is producing the work.
		It is suitably positioned to be both exhaustive and authoritative over the subject at hand.
		Think of offical documentation like the
		<a href="https://primarysources.yale.edu/"> primary sources </a>
		from history class.
		This is by far my favorite form of documentation.
		Nothing makes me feel warmer and fuzzier than downloading
		the <i>Official ________ _________ Reference Manual</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		However, it's unreasonable to expect people to produce
		such technically meritorious writing in multiple formats simultaneously, such as
		HTML, PDF, etc. (although GNU does an admirable job).
		As a consequence, official documentation
		is typically found in web-page format.
		Moreover, like the projects they are part of,
		official documentation is often community-driven.
	</p>

	<p>
		Several awesome examples spring to mind:
	</p>
	<ul class="big-list">
		<li>
			<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">
				The Rust Progamming Language</a>&mdash;
				Written by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols with updates from the community,
				this book is the main documentation of the Rust language.
				I think it's a great book, especially for its
				technical excellence.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://godotengine.org/">
					Godot Open Source Game Engine</a>&mdash;
					Godot is an MIT-licensed open source game engine.
					<a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/">Its official documentation</a> is community-driven.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html"> GNU's official documentation</a> is
					both supremely authoritative and exhaustive.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/"> Arch Linux's Wiki</a> is great,
					and almost always applies to distributions outside of Arch.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">Mozilla's HTML Docs</a>&mdash;
					Mozilla produces excellent documentation, primarily about web technologies.
					In addition, they help define
					the HTML living standard,<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
					and hence, represent an official voice with respect to modern HTML.
				</li>
			</ul>

		</div>

		<div id="unofficial-documentation" class="content">
			<h2> Unofficial Documentation </h2>
			<p>
				Most online documentation is from unofficial, secondary sources.
				Examples include this website, websites like it, question/answer sites,
				Youtube videos, podcasts, etc..
				Think of unofficial documentation as commentary on the subject at hand.
			</p>

			<p>
				Examples of good, unofficial documentation:
				<ul class="big-list">
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.linfo.org"> The Linux Information Project </a>&mdash;
						<em>LINFO</em> emphasizes useful, accurate, clear, consistent and interesting documentation of
						Linux<sup><a href="http://www.linfo.org/linfo_about.html">[3]</a></sup>.
						It's a neat site, but was last updated in 2007.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://tldp.org/"> The Linux Documentation Project</a>&mdash; Sadly, this project is not maintained anymore,
						so that its content is often out of date.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.man7.org/tlpi/index.html"> The Linux Programming Interface</a> by Michael Kerrisk&mdash;
						The de-facto reference for programming in Linux.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				A piece of advice: Stay away from books.
				The problem is that there's just too many of them, and better sources
				are often available.
				As my professor said, "There are a gazzillion books on Linux."
				(and I own, like, ten).
				They tend not to be authoritative; they tend to be *somewhat* out-of-date.
				Moreover, there's just no need to pay for a secondary source.
				I, personally, would rather read the
				<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual">Official GNU Bash Reference Manual</a>
				than any secondary source.
			</p>

			<p>
				There's an exception to every rule.
				Michael Kerrisk is currently the maintainer of the
				<a href="http://www.man7.org/">Linux Man Page project</a>;
				his book, <em>The Linux Programming Interface</em>, is an excellent text
				on the structures of the Linux kernel and the programming interface
				that it offers.

		<div id="tutorials" class="content">
			<h2> Tutorials </h2>

			<p>
				Tutorials are a great form of documentation,
				because they are informative, concise, and relevant.
				A tutorial jumps right in to the subject at hand.
			</p>

			<p>
				Good examples of good tutorials:
				<ul class="big-list">
					<li>
						<a href="https://youtu.be/mAbG8Oi-SvQ"> Make an Action RPG in Godot 3.2</a>&mdash;
						A Youtube tutorial for building your own Godot 3.2 game.
					</li>

					<li>
						<a href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com"> Learn Markdown</a>&mdash;
						A tutorial guide to markdown.
					</li>

					<li>
						<a href="https://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/">
							Making Your Own Ruby Gems</a> &mdash; Walks you through
							the creation of a Ruby software package (a.k.a., 'gem').
						</li>
					</ul>
