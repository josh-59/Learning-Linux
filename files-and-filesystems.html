To Do:


    <p>
        The UNIX file has been called "The Universal I/O Model"
Kerrisk calls File I/O "The Universal I/O Model"

    Somewhere:
        EOF, and CTRL+D

    Inodes 
    Directories
        Directory structure:

    Paths:
        A sequence of links- /usr/bin/ls
            start at root, /
            In /, go to file usr
            In /usr, go to file bin
            In /usr/bin, go to file ls
        Basename
        Dirname
        Absolute path
        Relative path

    FIFO & Sockets
    Add reference to findmnt (in mounting and unmounting)
    Sudo/Superuser priveledges

sysfs:
    A view of the kernel, not intended for inspection by system's administrators.


Filesystem Heirarchy:
    /var:
        (Double check:) Per-runtime variable files
        https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch05.html:
            /var contains logs, transient and temporary files
            Not shareable across systems


XDG Directory Specification
    ~/.config is defined as part of the XDG specification

Another convention:
    Each program is typically allowed one file in important system directories
    (e.g., <code>/etc</code>)
    If they have a single file to store, it may be stored plainly; if they
    have more than one file to store, they should make a subdirectory and
    store them within.

        "Theory and practice sometimes clash.  <br>
        And when that happens, theory loses.

        <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/326505/">Linus Torvalds</a>
    </div>

    <p>
        The protogenesis of Unix was a filesystem.<sup><a href=#references>[1]</a><a href="http://read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[2]</a></sup>
        Designed by the researchers of Bell Laboratories and
        implemented primarily by Ken Thompson,
        this piece of software became an operating system 
        when a means of interacting with, and executing, its contents was
        introduced.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="files" class="content">
    <h2>Files</h2>

    <p>
        In UNIX, a file is a sequence of bytes.<sup><a href=#references>[1]</a></sup>
        This definition is sufficiently abstract to allow, for instance, a keyboard
        to appear as a file.
        Unix-like kernels facilitate interaction with files via four essential
        system calls:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><code><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open(2)</a></code></li>
        <li><code><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a></code></li>
        <li><code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a></code></li>
        <li><code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a></code></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        In particular, the <code>read</code> system call fills a given
        buffer with the contents of a file;
        order is preserved across sequential calls to <code>read</code>.
        When a program requests a read, the kernel suspends its execution,
        loads the appropriate data, then resumes execution of the program.
    </p>

    <h3>File Attributes</h3>

    <p>
        UNIX-like operating systems characteristically store a substantial
        amount of information about each file on the system.
        This information, known as
        <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a>,</em>
        is stored alongside the file, typically on-disk.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Oddly, this information does not include the file's name.
            More on this below.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        File metadata consists of:
    </p>


    <ul>
        <li>File Type</li>
        <li>Read/Write/Execute Permissions</li>
        <li>Owner</li>
        <li>Group</li>
        <li>Size</li>
        <li>Timestamps</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This information is kept for every file on the machine,
        and can be explained in part by the operating system's multi-user heritage.
        It is used today to compartmentalize the machine.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="content" id="regular-files">
    <h2>Regular Files</h2>

    <p>
        A regular file is stored on disk, or some other persistent storage device.
        Most files are regular files.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here we have a typical <code>ls</code> listing:
    </p>

    <!--
        To do:
        - Change "wholename" to "name" (its being a wholename is coincidental to ls's
        invocation here)
        - Change character special and block special to device: special
    -->

    <div class="aside-right" style="margin-top:25px;">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Access restrictions are enforced by the kernel.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The first character, a hyphen (<code>-</code>), tells us that
        <code>/bin/bash</code> names a regular file.
        The next nine characters are the file's
        <a href="http://linfo.org/permissions.html">permission bits</a>;
        the <code>r</code> and <code>x</code> present in each trio indicates
        that this file is readable and executable (respectively) by any user on
        the system.
        The <code>w</code> present only in the owner trio indicates that the
        file may be written to only by its owner, who in this case
        is <code>root</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Two other tools useful for peeking
        into a file are <code><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/file.1.html">file</a></code>, which attempts to categorize the file, and
        <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/stat.1.html">stat</a></code>, which prints the file's complete metadata:
    </p>

    <div class="code">

    <p>
        To simply view the contents of a file, we can use the <code>less</code>
        paging utility, which displays one screenful of the file at a time.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="device-files" class="content">
    <h2>Device Files</h2>

    <p>
        The GNU/Linux directory tree is used as a general-purpose meeting place.
        In addition to regular files, it also contains
        information about running processes, information about the running kernel,
        and references to hardware&mdash; each in the form of files.
        This mechanism is general, extensible, and allows both users and programmers
        access to the running machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <em>device file</em> represents a device connected to the system.
        They reside in the <code>/dev</code> directory.<sup><a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch03s06.html">[4]</a></sup>
        Each of these files serves as the principle reference to its
        respective device.
        For instance, when a USB-stick is inserted into my machine,
        a new file appears in <code>/dev</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that the essential capabilities of the USB-stick are preserved through
        the <em>file</em> interface: We can read from it and write to it.
        If we were to add the capacity to <em>seek</em> (i.e., change location) 
        within the file, then we would be able to use the device in its entirety.
    </p>

    <h3> Block and Character Device Files </h3>

    <p>
        UNIX-like operating systems recognize two kinds of devices:
        <em>Block</em> and <em>character.</em>
        A character device supports reading and writing only a single
        byte (ASCII character) at a time; a terminal is one 
        kind of character device.
        Hard disks, SSD's and removable mass media are <em>block</em>
        devices:
        They support reading and writing blocks of bytes at a time&mdash; 
        usually, 4096 bytes.
        Additionally, block device files support seeking, whereas character devices
        do not.

<div class="content" id="pseudo-files">
    <h2>Pseudo Files</h2>

    <p>
        A <em>psuedo</em> or <em>synthetic</em> file does 
        not exist on disk, and does not exist on any persistent storage.
        They are synthesized by the kernel as processes interact
        with them (and the directories they are in).
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, <code>/proc/meminfo</code> is a 
        description of the the system's current memory usage:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ cat /proc/meminfo<br>
        MemTotal:        3887988 kB<br>
        MemFree:         1619568 kB<br>
        MemAvailable:    2450268 kB<br>
        Buffers:          120152 kB<br>
        Cached:           984208 kB<br>

        Inactive(anon):  1061224 kB<br>
        [...]
    </div>

    <p>
        The <code>/proc</code> and <code>/sys</code> directories are
        reserved for such files.
        <code>/proc</code> contains one directory for each 
        process on the system; each directory contains substantial 
        information about its respective process.
        <code>/sys</code> contains information pertaining to only the
        lowest-level system daemons.<sup><a href="http://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter09/udev.html">[c]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Other File Types:</strong>
    </p>

    <ul style="width: 70%; margin-left: 5%;">
        <li><p>
            <strong>FIFO:</strong> Also known as a <em>named pipe,</em> 
            this is a file type that connects one running program to another.
            "FIFO" stands for <em>First in, first out</em>.
        </li></p>

        <li><p>
            <strong>Socket:</strong> A file that supports interprocess 
            communication across networks.
        </li></p>
    </ul>

    <h3>A Bit More</h3>


    <p>
        Ken Thompson's UNIX kernel facilitated reading and writing 
        files, but otherwise refrained from interjecting upon their use.
        This approach was quite new for its time: Earlier
        operating systems interposed upon the handling of files, so that
        some files could only be read by some programs, and not by others.<sup><a href=#references>[1]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Thompson's strategy was to leave file interpretation to the program,
        and the resulting generality has become a hallmark of the UNIX platform.
        The four file operations apply to all file types except directories,
        whose structure (a mathematical tree) is protected by the kernel through 
        a distinct set of system calls.  
    </p>

<div class="content" id="inodes-and-directories">
    <h2>inodes and Directories</h2>

    <p>
        In keeping with traditional UNIX file semantics, 
        every file on a GNU/Linux system is represented by an unique <em>inode.</em><sup><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html#id1">[18]</a></sup>
        More, every path on the directory tree terminates in an unique inode reference.
        Inodes are the responsibility of their respective filesystem,
        wherein each is given a number.
        Within a filesystem, an inode number uniquely identifies an
        inode, and thereby uniquely identifies a file.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <em>directory</em> is a file that associates filenames (strings) with 
        inode numbers. 
        A directory cannot be <em>read()</em> directly, but may be viewed
        through <code>ls</code>:

        [...]
    </div>

    <p>
        Each such association is called a <em>hard link.</em>
        A hard link is created upon file creation;
        we can also create new hard links with the <code>ln</code> command,
        as the following sequence demonstrates:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ echo -n "Hello " &gt; newfile <br>
        $ ln newfile 2file <br>
        $ ls -i newfile 2file <br>
        2112949 newfile <br>
        2112949 2file <br>
    </div>

    <p>
        The name <code>2file</code> is equivalent to the name
        <code>newfile</code>.
        If we modify the file using one name,
        then we have modified the file referred to by the other:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ echo "world!" &gt;&gt; 2file<br>
        $ cat newfile<br>
        Hello world!
    </div>

    <p>
        A file may have more than one hard link, but when it has zero,
        it is no longer accessible through the directory tree, and
        the kernel prepares to delete it.<sup><a href="#references">[19]</a></sup>

        Within any UNIX-like operating system, some common themes will be found.
        For instance, <code>bin</code> directories are found in several places, such as
        <code>/bin</code>, <code>/sbin</code>, along with <code>/usr/bin</code>
        and often <code>/home/<i>user</i>/bin</code> as well.
        These contain binary executable files&ndash; programs&ndash; such as
        <code>bash</code> and <code>ls</code>.
        Other standard directories include <code>/root</code>, the root user's home
        directory, and <code>/proc</code>, and <code>/dev</code> as
        mentioned above.
        Some of these have been standard since Unix's inception,

        Each Unix-like operating system has a single root directory, <code>/</code>,
        which is the root of the system's directory tree.
        Every file in a Unix-like operating system may be addressed in absolute
        terms by giving its location relative to the root directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>/home</code> contains users' home directories.
        As user <em>josh</em>, my home directory is <code>/home/josh</code>.
        This path is commonly abbreviated to <code>~</code>.
        By default, it contains the usual "Music", "Movies", "Pictures" and
        "Downloads".
        Per-user configuration files are stored here, either as
        hidden files or in the directory <code>~/.config</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The directory <code>/etc</code> contains
        system-specific configuration files.
        It contains, for instance, files describing the configuration of
        the system's package manager, X11 window system configuration,
        and, well, etcetera.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>/tmp</code>, <code>/run</code>,  and <code>/var</code> each hold
        transient files of running programs.
        <code>/boot</code> holds everything required for the boot sequence,
        including my very own Linux kernel:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ file /boot/Image<br>
        Image:&emsp;&emsp; Linux kernel ARM64 boot executable Image, little-endian, 4k pages
    </div>

    <p>
        Software libraries are kind of boring, but essential to modern systems.
        The basic idea is to factor out repeated code (for instance,
        C's <code>printf</code> function) not just from the source code, but
        from <em>executable</em> files as well.
        This means that, when a bug or security vulnerability is found in
        <code>printf</code>, any program that uses the function will not
        have to be recompiled; rather, the appropriate library can be adjusted,
        and all dependant programs can continue operation in blissful ignorance
        of the change.
        Such executable files are said to be <em>dynamically linked,</em>
        and cannot be expected to run properly without their dependencies.
        <code>/lib</code> holds libraries.
    </p>

    <p>
        The last directory we will look at is <code>/usr</code>, which
        is more interesting. It contains user-shared files, such as
        man pages (in <code>/usr/share/man</code>) and most of the system's
        programs (in <code>/usr/bin</code>).
        These (regular) files are shared by all system users, and are mostly
        read-only.

    <h2>Mounting and Unmounting</h2>

    <p>
        UNIX-like operating systems maintain a single directory tree for
        the entire system.
        When a new block device is introduced to the machine, it first appears as
        a device file in <code>/dev</code>, and its files may then be made
        available by placing its filesystem's root directory
        in the existing directory tree.
        This operation is known as
        <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3192/what-is-meant-by-mounting-a-device-in-linux"><em>mounting</em></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's take a look at this, for it is new.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suppose we have a usb stick with some music on it, and we'd
        like to access its contents.
        When we plug it in, the hardware, then the kernel,
        recognize it, but it may not be accessible:
    </p>

    <img style="width:80%" src="assets/img/mounting.png">

    <p>
        The Linux Filesystem Heirarchy Standard provides two places to mount
        temporary filesystems: <code>/mnt</code> and <code>/media/[user]</code>.
        When mounting new devices manually, the usual method is to identify the
        device with
        <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lsblk.8.html"><code>lsblk</code></a>,
        then mount it with
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ sudo mount <i>device</i> <i>mountpoint</i>
    </div>

    <p>
        Superuser priveledges allow us to mount a filesystem anywhere.
        When a filesystem's is mounted to a directory that is not empty,
        those directory's contents become "hidden" by those of the new filesystem,
        and are inaccessible while the filesystem is mounted.
        Therefore, we typically create an empty directory in the existing
        directory tree, to serve as the to-be mounted filesystem's root
        directory.

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Closing Remarks</h2>
    <h4>inodes: A Historical Perspective</h4>

    <p>
        The inode was implemented literally in the Research UNIX filesystem,
        and formed the basis of its architecture:
    </p>

    <img src="">

    <p>
        In the design, data blocks are of fixed size, and either free or
        wholly consumed by a file.<sup><a href="#references">[20]</a></sup>
        The filesystem's <em>index nodes</em> represent one file each,
        contain their file's metadata, and contain pointers to data blocks.<sup><a href="#references">[20]</a></sup>
        These nodes are arranged in an array, and were uniquely identified
        by an index into this array.
    </p>

    <p>
        This design allows a file to grow or shrink without rearranging
        other files.<sup><a href="#references">[20]</a></sup>
        In addition, the inclusion of single-, double- and triple-
        indirection blocks allow the inode to remain of fixed,
        reasonable size, while supporting large
        files.<sup><a href="#references">[20]</a></sup>
        Finally, by using direct pointers for the first bytes of a file,
        the design fostered the speedy retrieval of data in small
        files.<sup><a href="#references">[20]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        It was the most advanced filesystem of its time,
        and, as UNIX grew in popularity, was propogated and revised.
        <em>Index node</em> became contracted to <em>inode</em>,
        and the semantics of file operations in UNIX-like operating systems
        became dependant upon them.
    </p>

    <p>
        The design was demonstrated in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix">MINIX</a> filesystem,
        which in turn served as Linux's pre-1.0 filesystem.
        The <em>extended</em> filesystem, <code>ext</code>, extended
        those filesystem's capabilities.
        With <code>ext</code>'s inclusion in kernel 0.96c, Linux began to use
        its new <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html">Virtual File System</a>,
        a kernel subsystem that provides userspace with a
        uniform filesystem interface.
    </p>

    <p>
        While each filesystem implements its own functionality,
        most functionality is common;
        the Virtual File System provides a uniform interface to user-space by
        mapping filesystem-related system calls to filesystem-driver functions.
        In addition, the VFS imposes inodes on filesystems that do not
        natively employ them, thereby preserving traditional UNIX file
        semantics across all supported filesystems.
