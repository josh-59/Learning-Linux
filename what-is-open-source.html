    To do: Put in intro-to-unix?
        Since source code is available whenever the runnable program 
        is available, and any user may
        redistribute the product, there is no difference between 
        'distributing' a piece of free software and 'releasing' it.

    Working In Public

    Notes:
        The term <em>open source</em> describes the way that software
        is distributed and used, not to how it is produced.

        Although the spirit of Free Software is clear&mdash; it respects
        users' freedom&mdash;
        ...projects like Audacity threaten to reduce the term "Open Source"
        to a buzzword, similar to "green" or "organic."
        What it is, how it's different...
    </p>

    <h2><em>Not</em> Collaboration</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Recall that <em>open source</em> is a synonym for
            <em>free software.</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Properly speaking, open-source describes only how
        software is distributed and used&mdash; Not how
        it is produced.<sup><a href="#references" title="Eghbal p44">[a]</a></sup>
        Notably, it requires human-readable "source" be available 
        whenever machine-readable instructions are available.
        The term does not restrict
        the organizational structure adopted to produce
        these works, and many open-source projects are <em>not</em> 
        open to collaboration.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, GNU is not collaborative:
        While users are permitted to
        modify and redistribute GNU's works, those modifications 
        were never intended to make their way back into GNU source.
        Hence, there is a deliberate delineation between <em>user</em> and 
        <em>developer.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        This development model is now referred to as the 
        <em>Cathedral</em> model, and largely reflects the "firm"
        or "corporate" structure that had proved most successful
        at the time.
    </p>

    <h3>Collaborative Open Source</h3>
    
    <p>
        When Linus Torvalds invited any interested hacker to
        tinker on his kernel, he invented a new
        way of making free software:
        Changes are submitted <em>by individuals to projects,</em>
        inspected on a case-by-case basis, and then either
        accepted into the project or rejected
        at the project leader's discretion.
        The idea was "Accidentally Revolutionary," and has
        dominated open-source since.
    </p>

    <p>
        This model is by nature distributed, with anyone anywhere
        welcome to submit (completed) modifications to present works.
        Project leaders take on the responsibility of their work's 
        overall well-being, and can modify the code however they see
        fit. 
        Thus, open-source is often <em>collaborative,</em> but 
        it is not a synonym for <em>collaboration.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        It should be noted that there is no "rule" that collaboration
        is restricted to hobbyists, and being inclusive with
        respect to organizations fosters project success.
        Facebook, for example, has put considerable effort
        into Linux's new <code><a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">btrfs</a></code>,<sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/824855/">[h]</a></sup>
        commonly described as a "modern, copy-on-write filesystem."

    <h2>Moneyed?</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>
            Formally, we will only be considering those qualities
            shared by both <em>Free Software</em> and <em>Open Source.</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        All open-source software may be redistributed by any user.  
        This qualification may be explicit, as in the case of
        copyleft licenses; or, it may be implicit by
        <em>not forbidding</em> redistribution, as in the case
        of public domain works.
        This stipulation does not forbid the sale of open-source software.
    </p>

    <p>
        While free software is traditionally a hobbyist' production,
        and is traditionally available free of charge, there
        are/can-be/will-be moneyed interests seeking to maximize
        profit by selling open-source products, as in the case
        of Audacity.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the first place, the rights of free software apply 
        only <em>to users:</em> While every user has access to source
        code and may redistribute the work, neither the compiled product
        nor the source code are necessarily available to the public.
        Any user, of course, may make both project and source publicly
        available.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the beginning, this was intended to foster support for
        GNU: GNU

<div class="content" id="freedom-to-use">
    <h2>Freedom to Use</h2>

    <p>
        Free software may be used for any purpose, including (but not
        limited to) commercial purposes.
        This contasts with proprietary software, whose use may be
        restricted at its owner's discretion.

    <h2>Ownership in Open-Source</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Here we will restrict our language to the term <em>release.</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        
    </p>

    <p>
        I prefer instead to identify what <em>is</em> owned in
        open-source: 
        <em>You the user own your copy of the software, until you
        decide to release it.</em>
        Thereupon, any user owns a copy, and may release it
        themselves&mdash; etc etc..
        Thus, open source one type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-culture_movement">free work</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Probably the most important component is the codebase&mdash;
        the source repository.
        Again, until this repository is released, its owner 
        decides everything about it, including what goes into it,
        and when (if) it is released.
        Linus Torvalds, for example, has the power to <em>never release</em>
        another kernel; he could simply collect and perfect the
        source on his own.
        Point is, the repository maintainer is in no way obliged to 
        respond to any proposed commit&mdash; They don't even have
        to respond to your email.
