	<h1>Documentation</h1>
	

	<div class="aside-right">
		<h4>Aside:</h4>
		<p>
			In days' past, it was common practice to inspect source code as documentation.
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		The Free-and-Open-Source Software (FOSS) community centers around projects.
		At the center of each project is its code.
		Official documentation, if it exists, is part of the project.
		Outside the project, there is unofficial documentation.
		Finally, at the periphery, is opinion.
		Good, organized documentation is very important to the success of a project.
		This paper discusses different sources of information, and where they may be appropriate.
	</p>


</div>

<div id="man-pages" class="content">
	<h2> Man Pages </h2>
	<p>
		By far, the most useful asset in the Linux documentation pool is the
		manual ("man") pages.
		These date to the first implementations of Unix,<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html">[1]</a></sup>
		where they were the user's primary source for information about the new operating system.
		Man pages provide a concise overview of commands and features, with further documentation
		existing elsewhere.
		Learn to use man pages early, for they are a way of life.
	</p>

	<p>
		Man pages are accessed at the command line:
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		$ man cat
	</div>

	<p>
		Once within the <code>man</code> utility, you can easily search the content
		by typing a single forward slash, then your search term:
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		/&lt;search-term&gt;
	</div>

	<p>
		Then, <em>enter</em>.  Jump to the next result by typing a single
        <code>n</code>.
		To quit the <code>man</code> paging utility, type <code>q</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
        The controls of the <code>man</code> paging utility are simple enough:
		To move down one line, type <code>j</code>;
		to move up one line, use <code>k</code>.
		To move down a screenful, press the spacebar.
	</p>

	<h3>Sections</h3>

	<p>
		The manual is divided into seven different sections, as shown below.
		Here we will use the standard convention for specifying specific man pages:
        The name of the page is followed by its section number, which is placed in
        parenthesis.
        For example,
		<code>cat(1)</code> refers to the manual page for the command-line utility,
		while <code>printf(3)</code> refers to the manual page of the C library function.
	</p>

    <div class="aside-right">
		<h4>Manual Sections:</h4>
        <ol>
			<li> Shell Commands </li>
			<li> Systems Calls </li>
			<li> C Library Functions </li>
			<li> Special Files </li>
			<li> File Formats and Conventions </li>
			<li> Games </li>
			<li> Miscellaneous</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<p>
		The <code>man</code> utility searches the sections in order, and so
		defaults to the page with the lowest section number.
		Hence,
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		$ man printf
	</div>

	<p>
		displays <code>printf(1)</code>, if it exists.
		To restrict <code>man</code>'s search to section three, we can use either
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		$ man 3 printf
	</div>

	<p>
		or
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		$ man printf.3
	</div>

<div id="official-documentation" class="content">
	<h2> Official Documentation </h2>

	<p>
		Official documentation originates from the group or organization
		that is producing the work; it's part of the project itself.
		It is suitably positioned to be both exhaustive and authoritative over the subject.
		Think of official documentation like the primary sources
		from history class.
	</p>

	<p>
		Like the projects they are part of, official documentation is usually
		community-driven.
		Moreover, it is typically found in web-page format.
	</p>

	<p>
		Several examples spring to mind:
	</p>
	<ul class="big-list">
		<li>
			<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/"> The Linux Kernel Documentation</a>&mdash;
			A book-like website documenting the latest kernel.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/"> Arch Linux's Wiki</a>&mdash;
			The official documentation of the Arch distribution.
			This is an excellent resource, and its material often applies to distributions outside of Arch.
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href="https://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html"> GNU's Official Docs</a>&mdash;
			Excellent documentation. It is both supremely authoritative and exhaustive,
			but owing to its precision, and the precision of the work they do, it can be
			difficult to read.
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Open Source Game Engine</a>&mdash;
			Godot is an MIT-licensed open source game engine.
			Its <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/">official documentation</a> is community-driven.
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/">Rust's Library Documentation</a>&mdash;
			This documentation scheme is fantastic.  It was created with the developer in mind,
			and is easy to navigate, easy to read, and makes the libraries easy to
			comprehend.
			Moreover, facilities are included in the compiler itself,
			which permit documentation extraction from source-code comments.
			It's easy, fast and clean.
		</li>
	</ul>

</div>

<div id="unofficial-documentation" class="content">
	<h2> Unofficial Documentation </h2>
	<p>
		Most documentation is from unofficial, secondary sources.
		Examples include this website, blogs, question/answer sites,
		Youtube videos, podcasts, books, etc..
		Think of unofficial documentation as commentary on the subject at hand.
		It can be useful when the subject is difficult,
		but official documentation should still be your reference.
	</p>

	<p>
		Examples of good, unofficial documentation:
	</p>

	<ul class="big-list">
		<li>
			<a href="http://tldp.org/"> The Linux Documentation Project</a>&mdash;
			From the website: "TLDP is short for The Linux Documentation Project,
			an organization of volunteers authoring, reviewing and managing
			documents about the Linux operating system. Documents basically
			come in two formats based upon their length. The shorter ones
			generally are called HOWTOs (or mini-HOWTOs, if they are really short),
			the longer documents, called guides, deal in-depth with a Linux
			feature."<sup><a href="http://tldp.org/history.html">[2]</a></sup>
			<br>
			<br>
			TLDP is not maintained anymore, so that its content is sometimes
			out-of-date (but still very good).

		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://debian-handbook.info/"> Debian Administrator's Handbook</a>&mdash;
			A free book written by RaphaÃ«l Hertzog and Roland Mas, two Debian developers.
			It was originally written in French, and has been translated into
			four other languages, with twenty(!) more in-progress.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/"> Linux From Scratch </a>&mdash;
			From their website, "Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides
			you with step-by-step instructions for building your own customized
			Linux system entirely from source."<sup><a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/index.html">[3]</a></sup>
			It's a thing.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="http://www.kroah.com/lkn/"> Linux Kernel in a Nutshell</a>&mdash;
			A free book written by Greg Kroah-Hartman.
			He says, "I want this book to help
			bring more people into the Linux kernel development fold.
			The act of building a customized kernel for your machine is one
			of the basic tasks needed to become a Linux kernel developer.
			The more people that try this out, and realize that there is
			not any real magic behind the whole Linux kernel process, the
			more people will be willing to jump in and help out in making
			the kernel the best that it can be."<sup><a href="http://www.kroah.com/lkn/">[4]</a></sup>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="content" id="nf-books">
	<h2>Nonfree Books</h2>
	<p>
		In the main, I recommend staying away from non-free *nix books.
		There are several reasons for this.
	</p>

	<p>
		First, non-free books are almost always secondary sources, and hence,
		not authoritative.
		The books you want to read are by those people closest to
		the FOSS community, and they usually (but not always) write free books.
		If it is free, they often offer a paperback copy for sale,
		and/or a means to donate/support.
	</p>

	<p>
		Second, there's just too many of them, and very few are worthwhile.
		For instance, I bought a handbook on UNIX system administration
		that looked very promising, but taught me precious little.
		In fact, the free <a href="https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/">Debian Administrator's Handbook</a>
		proved a more succinct, more authoritative resource.
	</p>

	<p>
		Third, they tend to be out-of-date.
		For example, I really liked the premise of
		<a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Molay-Understanding-UNIX-LINUX-Programming-A-Guide-to-Theory-and-Practice/PGM190781.html">
			Understanding UNIX/LINUX Programming: A Guide to Theory and Practice
		</a>.
		It walks you through programming in Linux by recreating
		common command-line tools, such as <code>cat</code> and <code>ls</code>, but it
		was so out-of-date by the time I read it that the information in it couldn't be trusted.
		It'd be great to see this rewritten in a modern context.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some exceptions:
	</p>

	<ul class="big-list">
		<li> <a href="https://www.man7.org/tlpi/index.html">The Linux Programming Interface</a>&mdash;
			This is the definitive text on the programming interface
			of the Linux Kernel.
			If you want all the gory details of the system-call interface offered
			by the Linux kernel, as well as sound explanations of its
			internals, this is your book.
			Its writer, Michael Kerrisk, is currently the maintainer of the
			Linux Man Page project (see above),
			and his work is simply terrific.
		</li>
		<li> <a href="http://www.csapp.cs.cmu.edu/">Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective</a> &mdash;
			From its preface: "This book (known as CS:APP) is for computer scientists, computer engineers,
			and others who want to be able to write better programs by learning what is going on
			"under the hood" of a computer system."<sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>

	</ul>

<div id="how-to" class="content">
	<h2>How-to</h2>

	<p>
		It's worthwhile to take a step back and consider the process
		of learning Linux itself.
		In my experience, the best method of learning Linux is to focus on the
		underlying concepts:
		When the concept is understood, one can usually "feel" one's way through
		rectifying the situation at the command line.
		Let's take an example.
	</p>

	<p>
		Suppose you are working at the command-line, and you have a question about
		copying files.
		Knowing that the command <code>cp</code> copies a file,
		you type <code>man cp</code>, and the manual page appears.
		When you type <code>apropos copy</code>, looking for other
		commands that can copy a file, it shows no results.
		You know this to be an error, because <code>apropos</code>
		is supposed to search manual pages and list all that
		match "copy," which would certainly include <code>cp</code>.
	</p>

	<ol class="big-list" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
		<li>
			<i>Figure out what your question is.</i>
			<p>
				Initially, your question might be <em>Why doesn't this work?</em>&mdash;
				and that's totally fine.
				Figuring out your question can be more difficult than you'd guess,
				because you might not know how to phrase it.
				Try to be specific:
				When dealing with computers, things are <em>very</em> precisely defined.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here, the question is, <em>Why isn't <code>apropos</code> returning
				any results?</em>
		</li>

		<li>
			<i>What would answer your question?</i>
			<p>
				This strikes you as such an obvious error
				that any reasonable documentation should answer your question&mdash;
				and you would be right.
				So, you look first into the man pages, with
				<code>man apropos</code>.
				There, you discover that <code>apropos</code> doesn't search the man
				pages <em>directly,</em> but instead searches a database of information
				about them. (It does this because it's much faster.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Reasonably, you suspect that there might be an error with this database,
				such as, <em>It doesn't exist</em>.
				A little further down the page, you read,
				"The database searched by <code>apropos</code> is updated by <code>mandb</code>.
				You try <code>mandb</code>, and voila! <code>apropos</code> works as it should.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<i>Be Patient.</i>

			<p>
				Databases like this pop up in other
				contexts, as well.  For instance, in package management, a common
				practice is to maintain a local database about available packages, so that
				the user can search for packages without bothering public servers.
				As such, updating these databases (on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint, with <code>apt update</code>)
				is a precursive step to obtaining the latest packages.
			</p>

			<p>
				The point here is that you should take the time to try to
				learn underlying concepts, because it usually pays off in the long run.
                <em>Skill accrues.</em> Answer one question at a time.
			</p>
