		Linux is a very large subject.
		Although there are many sources of documentation, they are not,
		in general, well-organized, so that finding the right information
		can be hard.
		This makes good information harder-won than it ought to be,
		and implies that finding good (i.e., appropriate) sources  is a skill in itself.
	</p>

	<p>
		This paper gives an overview of available resources,
		some examples of each, and useful pointers, where appropriate.
		First, though, we make explicit the process of determining appropriate sources.

<div id="how-to" class="content">
	<h2>How-to</h2>

    <p>
        Suppose you are working at the command-line, and you have a question about
        copying files.
        Knowing that the command <code>cp</code> copies a file,
        you type <code>man cp</code>, and the manual page appears.
        When you type <code>apropos copy</code>, looking for other
        commands that can copy a file, it shows no results&mdash;
        you know this to be an error, because <code>apropos</code>
        is supposed to search manual pages and list all that
        match "copy".
    </p>

	<ol class="big-list" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
		<li>
			<i>Figure out what your question is.</i>
            <p>
                Initially, your question might be <em>Why this no work,</em>
                and that's totally fine.
				Figuring out your question can be more difficult than you might guess,
				because you might not know how to phrase it.
				Try to be specific:
                When dealing with computers, things are <em>very</em> precisely defined.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<i>What would answer your question?</i>
            <p>
                This strikes you as such an obvious error
                that any reasonable documentation should answer your question
                (and you would be right).
                So, you first look into the man pages, with
                <code>man apropos</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                There, you discover that <code>apropos</code> doesn't search the man
                pages <em>directly,</em> but instead searches a database of information
                about them (it does this because it's much faster).
                Reasonably, you suspect that there might be an error with this database
                (such as, it doesn't exist).
            </p>

            <p>
                A little further down the page, you read,
                "The database searched by <code>apropos</code> is updated by <code>mandb</code>.
                You run the program, and voila! <code>apropos</code> works as it should.
            </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Revise.</i>
			<p>
				Do you need more information? Or less?
				Should it be a simpler source, or more involved?
				You might find that your practical knowledge is
				lacking some kind of <i>body</i>; in this case, you are
				looking to frame your knowledge in a more-general theory.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Be Patient.</i>
			<p>
			    Databases like this pop up in other
                contexts, as well.  For instance, in package management, a common
                practice is to maintain a local database of package metadata, so that
                the user can search for packages without bothering public servers.
                As such, updating these databases (on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint, with <code>apt update</code>)
                is a precursive step to obtaining the latest packages.
            </p>

            <p>
                The point here is that you should try to take the time
                to learn underlying concepts, because it usually pays off in the long run.
			   	Skill accrues. Answer one question at a time.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>

    <p>
        By far, the worst habit to get into is expecting to be spoon-fed solutions as though
        by technical support.
        Imagine, for a second, that you had *instantly* appealed to
        Google, and there you found a response such as,
        "Just run <code>mandb</code>."
        This is correct, and it solves your problem, but you've learned nothing, and
        if you continue "learning" this way, you'll be stuck memorizing trivial idioms.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Linux is written by programmers, for programmers.</em>
        It is very pure with respect to computer science, and being a competent user
        necessarily requires some CS know-how.
        If you're not interested in learning that, then find somewhere else to go
        (but if you are interested, stick around!).
    </p>
</div>

<div id="man-pages" class="content">
	<h2> Man Pages </h2>
	<p>
		By far the most useful asset in the Linux documentation pool is the
		manual ("man") pages.
		Man pages date back to the first implementations of Unix,<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html">[1]</a></sup>
		where they were the user's primary documentation of the newly-minted operating system.
		They often included examples, hints and useful suggestions, such as,
		<a href="http://man.cat-v.org/unix-1st/1/cat">"<em>cat file</em> is about the easiest way to print a file."</a>
	</p>

	<p>
		Today, the man pages are <a href="http://www.man7.org/">maintained by Michael Kerrisk,</a>
		and often include examples, hints, and useful suggestions,
		such as, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getdents.2.html">"These are not the interfaces you are interested in.</a>"
		Learn to use man pages early, for they are a way of life.
	</p>

	<div class="aside-right" style="margin-left: 25pt; padding-bottom: 0">
		<h4>Manual Sections:</h4>
		<ol style="margin-left:0">
			<li> Shell Commands </li>
			<li> Systems Calls </li>
			<li> C Library Functions </li>
			<li> Special Files </li>
			<li> File Formats and Conventions </li>
			<li> Games </li>
			<li> Miscellaneous</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<p>
		Man pages are accessed at the command line so:
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		man app
	</div>

	<p>
		You can search through available man pages with the <code>apropos</code> command,
		as in,
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		apropos decompress
	</div>

	<p>
		or
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		apropos extract
	</div>

	<p>
		Technically speaking, this utility searches the single-line, "short description"
		of each man page, and prints out the names and descriptions of programs that match your search
		(<code><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/apropos.1.html">man apropos</a></code> for more information).
	</p>

	<p>
		Once within the <code>man</code> utility, you can easily search the content
		by typing a forward slash, then your search term:
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		/&lt;search-term&gt;
	</div>

	<p>
		Then, <em>enter</em>.  To jump to the next result, type a single <b>n</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Many of the controls of the man-pages coincide with those of
		the <code>less</code> paging utility, and the <code>vim</code>
		text editor, so they're worth learning.
		For instance, to move down one line, type <b>j</b>.
		To move up one line, type <b>k</b>.
		And, move down a screenful by hitting the spacebar.
		Why the crazy controls?  It keeps your fingers on the home row.
	</p>

	<p>
		The manual is structured into sections, as shown above.
		In particular, Section 1 contains entries for user commands,
		such as <code>cat</code>, <code>man</code>, <code>mv</code> and <code>cp</code>,
		while Section 3 contains the manual pages for C library functions, such as
		<code>getline()</code>, <code>printf()</code> and <code>strtol()</code>.
		When using <code>apropos</code>, one can restrict the search to a particular section with the <code>-s</code> switch:
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		apropos -s 3 printf
	</div>

	<p>
		Otherwise, <code>apropos</code> lists them all.
	</p>

	<p>
		In addition, each manual page is organized into
		a common format.
		For instance, each page has a "See Also" section near the bottom,
		which lists related commands/library functions.
	</p>

<div id="official-documentation" class="content">
	<h2> Official Documentation </h2>

	<p>
		Official documentation originates from the group or organization
		that is producing the work.
		It is suitably positioned to be both exhaustive and authoritative over the subject at hand.
		Think of offical documentation like the
		<a href="https://primarysources.yale.edu/"> primary sources </a>
		from history class.
		This is by far my favorite form of documentation.
		Nothing makes me feel warmer and fuzzier than downloading
		the <i>Official ________ _________ Reference Manual</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		However, it's unreasonable to expect people to produce
		such technically meritorious writing in multiple formats simultaneously, such as
		HTML, PDF, etc. (although GNU does an admirable job).
		As a consequence, official documentation
		is typically found in web-page format.
		Moreover, like the projects they are part of,
		official documentation is often community-driven.
	</p>

	<p>
		Several awesome examples spring to mind:
	</p>
	<ul class="big-list">
		<li>
			<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">
				The Rust Progamming Language</a>&mdash;
				Written by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols with updates from the community,
				this book is the main documentation of the Rust language.
				I think it's very well-written, especially notable for its
				technical excellence.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/"> Arch Linux's Wiki</a> is great,
				and almost always applies to distributions outside of Arch.
			</li>

				<li>
					<a href="https://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html"> GNU's official documentation</a> is
					both supremely authoritative and exhaustive.
				</li>

				<li>
					<a href="https://godotengine.org/">
						Godot Open Source Game Engine</a>&mdash;
						Godot is an MIT-licensed open source game engine.
						Its <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/">official documentation</a> is community-driven.
					</li>

				<li>
					<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">Mozilla's HTML Docs</a>&mdash;
					Mozilla produces excellent documentation, primarily about web technologies.
					In addition, they help define
					the HTML living standard,<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
					and hence, represent an official voice with respect to modern HTML.
				</li>
			</ul>

		</div>

		<div id="unofficial-documentation" class="content">
			<h2> Unofficial Documentation </h2>
			<p>
				Most online documentation is from unofficial, secondary sources.
				Examples include this website, websites like it, question/answer sites,
				Youtube videos, podcasts, etc..
				Think of unofficial documentation as commentary on the subject at hand.
			</p>

			<p>
				Examples of good, unofficial documentation:
				<ul class="big-list">
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.linfo.org"> The Linux Information Project</a>&mdash;
						<em>LINFO</em> emphasizes useful, accurate, clear, consistent and interesting documentation of
						Linux<sup><a href="http://www.linfo.org/linfo_about.html">[3]</a></sup>.
						It's a neat site, but was last updated in 2007.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://tldp.org/"> The Linux Documentation Project</a>&mdash; Sadly, this project is not maintained anymore,
						so that its content is usually out of date.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
	</div>

	<div class="content" id="books">
		<h2>Books</h2>
			<p>
				In the main, I recommend staying away from books.
				There are several reasons for this.
				First, there's just too many of them, and very few are worthwhile.
				The result is that the reader wastes a lot of time just figuring
				out which to study from.
				Second, they are almost always secondary sources, and hence not authoritative.
				In particular, there must be a thousand <em>Introduction to Linux</em>
				books.
				Third, they tend to be *somewhat* out-of-date.
				I guess there's not much money in writing books, because it's rare that
				they are maintained properly.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are a few exceptions:

				<ul class="big-list">
					<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">The C Programming Language, Second Edition</a>&mdash;
						The only resource a C programmer needs.
					</li>
					<li> <a href="https://www.man7.org/tlpi/index.html">The Linux Programming Interface</a> by Michael Kerrisk&mdash;
						This book is the definitive text on the programming interface
						of the Linux Kernel.
						Michael Kerrisk is currently the maintainer of the
						<a href="http://www.man7.org/">Linux Man Page project</a>,
						and his work is simply terrific.
					</li>
				</ul>

		<div id="tutorials" class="content">
			<h2> Tutorials </h2>

			<p>
				Tutorials are a great form of documentation,
				because they are informative, concise, and relevant.
				A tutorial jumps right in to the subject at hand.
			</p>

			<p>
				Good examples of good tutorials:
				<ul class="big-list">
					<li>
