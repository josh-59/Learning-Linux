		The Free-and-Open-Source Software (FOSS) community centers around projects.
		At the center of each project is its code.
		Outside of that is its official documentation;
		outside that, unofficial documentation.
		Finally, at the periphery, is opinion.
		Documentation is part of each project; I believe that appropriate
		documentation is very important to the success of a project.
	</p>
</div>



<div id="man-pages" class="content">
	<h2> Man Pages </h2>
	<p>
		The most useful asset in the Linux documentation pool is the
		manual ("man") pages.
		These date back to the first implementations of Unix,<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html">[1]</a></sup>
		where they were the user's primary documentation of the new operating system.
		They often included examples, hints and useful suggestions, such as,
		<a href="http://man.cat-v.org/unix-1st/1/cat">"<em>cat file</em> is about the easiest way to print a file."</a>
	</p>

	<p>
		Each project maintains their own man page (if any),
		and this is usually installed automatically for you, through your distribution's
		package manager.
		The pages for the Linux kernel and C library interfaces have become
		<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/">a separate project.</a>
		Learn to use man pages early, for they are a way of life.
	</p>

	<div class="aside-right" style="margin-left: 25pt; padding-bottom: 0">
		<h4>Manual Sections:</h4>
		<ol style="margin-left:0">
			<li> Shell Commands </li>
			<li> Systems Calls </li>
			<li> C Library Functions </li>
			<li> Special Files </li>
			<li> File Formats and Conventions </li>
			<li> Games </li>
			<li> Miscellaneous</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<p>
		Man pages are accessed at the command line so:
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		man app
	</div>

	<p>
		You can search through available man pages with the <code>apropos</code> command,
		as in,
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		apropos decompress
	</div>

	<p>
		or
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		apropos extract
	</div>

	<p>
		Technically speaking, this utility searches the single-line, "short description"
		of each man page, and prints out the names and descriptions of programs that match your search
		(<code><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/apropos.1.html">apropos(1)</a></code> for more information).
	</p>

	<p>
		Once within the <code>man</code> utility, you can easily search the content
		by typing a forward slash, then your search term:
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		/&lt;search-term&gt;
	</div>

	<p>
		Then, <em>enter</em>.  To jump to the next result, type a single <b>n</b>.
		This makes it fast and easy to find relevant information.
	</p>

	<p>
		Many of the controls of the man-pages coincide with those of
		the <code>less</code> paging utility, and the <code>vim</code>
		text editor, so they're worth learning.
		For instance, to move down one line, type <b>j</b>.
		To move up one line, type <b>k</b>.
		And, move down a screenful by hitting the spacebar.
		Why the crazy controls?  It keeps your fingers on the home row.
	</p>

	<p>
		The manual is structured into sections, as shown above.
		We use a shorthand for denoting man pages:  "printf(3)" refers
		to the man page named <em>printf</em>, in the third section,
		as opposed to printf(1), in the first.
		When using <code>apropos</code>, one can restrict the search to a particular section with the <code>-s</code> switch:
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		apropos -s 3 printf
	</div>

	<p>
		Finally, each manual page has a common format.
		For instance, each page has a "See Also" section near the bottom,
		which lists related commands or library functions.
	</p>

	<h3>See Also:</h3>

<div id="official-documentation" class="content">
	<h2> Official Documentation </h2>

	<p>
		Official documentation originates from the group or organization
		that is producing the work; it is part of the project itself.
		It is suitably positioned to be both exhaustive and authoritative over the subject.
		Think of offical documentation like the
		<a href="https://primarysources.yale.edu/"> primary sources </a>
		from history class.
	</p>

	<p>
		Like the projects they are part of, official documentation is usually
		community-driven.
		Moreover, it is typically found in web-page format.
	</p>

	<p>
		Several examples spring to mind:
	</p>
	<ul class="big-list">
		<li>
			<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/"> The Linux Kernel Documentation</a>&mdash;
			A book-like website documenting the latest kernel.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/"> Arch Linux's Wiki</a>&mdash;
			The official documentation of the Arch distribution.
			This is an excellent resource, and its material often applies to distributions outside of Arch.
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href="https://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html"> GNU's Official Docs</a>&mdash;
			Excellent documentation. It is both supremely authoritative and exhaustive,
			but owing to its precision, and the precision of the work they do, it can be
			difficult to read.  Also, note that they offer (the same) documentation in multiple
			formats: HTML, PDF, and through their own <code>info(1)</code> utility.
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Open Source Game Engine</a>&mdash;
			Godot is an MIT-licensed open source game engine.
			Its <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/">official documentation</a> is community-driven.
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">
				The Rust Progamming Language</a>&mdash;
				A book written by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols with updates from the community,
				this is part of the official documentation of the Rust language.
				I think it's very well-written, especially notable for its
				technical excellence.
			</li>
		</ul>

	</div>

	<div id="unofficial-documentation" class="content">
		<h2> Unofficial Documentation </h2>
		<p>
			Most documentation is from unofficial, secondary sources.
			Examples include this website, blogs, question/answer sites,
			Youtube videos, podcasts, books, etc..
			Think of unofficial documentation as commentary on the subject at hand.
			It can be useful when the subject is difficult,
			but official documentation should still be your reference.
		</p>

		<p>
			Examples of good, unofficial documentation:
		</p>

		<ul class="big-list">
			<li>
				<a href="http://tldp.org/"> The Linux Documentation Project</a>&mdash;
				From the website: "TLDP is short for The Linux Documentation Project,
				an organization of volunteers authoring, reviewing and managing
				documents about the Linux operating system. Documents basically
				come in two formats based upon their length. The shorter ones
				generally are called HOWTOs (or mini-HOWTOs, if they are really short),
				the longer documents, called guides, deal in-depth with a Linux
				feature."<sup><a href="http://tldp.org/history.html">[2]</a></sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				TLDP is not maintained anymore, so that its content is sometimes
				out-of-date (but still very good).

			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://debian-handbook.info/"> Debian Administrator's Handbook</a>&mdash;
				A free book written by RaphaÃ«l Hertzog and Roland Mas, two Debian developers.
				It was originally written in French, and has been translated into
				four other languages, with twenty(!) more in-progress.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/"> Linux From Scratch </a>&mdash;
				From their website, "Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides
				you with step-by-step instructions for building your own customized
				Linux system entirely from source."<sup><a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/index.html">[3]</a></sup>
				It's a thing.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="http://www.kroah.com/lkn/"> Linux Kernel in a Nutshell</a>&mdash;
				A free book written by Greg Kroah-Hartman.
				He says, "I want this book to help
				bring more people into the Linux kernel development fold.
				The act of building a customized kernel for your machine is one
				of the basic tasks needed to become a Linux kernel developer.
				The more people that try this out, and realize that there is
				not any real magic behind the whole Linux kernel process, the
				more people will be willing to jump in and help out in making
				the kernel the best that it can be."<sup><a href="http://www.kroah.com/lkn/">[4]</a></sup>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Note:  GNU/Linux is an open-source community; respect it by avoiding
			commercial (.com) sites that "offer" advice and documentation about Linux.
			Also, StackOverflow is not the appropriate avenue for bug reports.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="content" id="nf-books">
		<h2>Nonfree Books</h2>
		<p>
			In the main, I recommend staying away from non-free *nix books.
			There are several reasons for this.
		</p>

		<p>
			First, there's just too many of them, and very few are worthwhile.
			For instance, I bought a handbook on UNIX system administration
			that looked very promising, but taught me precious little.
			In fact, the free <a href="https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/">Debian Administrator's Handbook</a>
			proved a more succinct, more direct and more appropriate resource.
		</p>

		<div class="aside-right">
			<h4>Aside:</h4>
			<p>
				My aim here is to warn the reader, not to make light of other peoples'
				work.
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			Second, non-free books are almost always secondary sources, and hence not authoritative;
			moreover, there's a good chance that the one you try will not be the best
			resource.
		</p>

		<p>
			Third, they tend to be *somewhat* out-of-date.
			For example, I really liked the premise of
			<a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Molay-Understanding-UNIX-LINUX-Programming-A-Guide-to-Theory-and-Practice/PGM190781.html">
				Understanding UNIX/LINUX Programming: A Guide to Theory and Practice</a>.
				It walks you through programming in Linux by recreating
				common command-line tools, such as <code>cat(1)</code> and <code>ls(1)</code>, but it
				was so out-of-date by the time I read it that the information in it couldn't be trusted.
				It'd be great to see this rewritten in a modern context.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some exceptions:
			</p>

			<ul class="big-list">
				<li> <a href="https://www.man7.org/tlpi/index.html">The Linux Programming Interface</a>&mdash;
					This is the definitive text on the programming interface
					of the Linux Kernel.
					If you want all the gory details of the system-call interface offered
					by the Linux kernel, as well as sound explanations of its
					internals, this is your book.
					Its writer, Michael Kerrisk, is currently the maintainer of the
					<a href="http://www.man7.org/">Linux Man Page project</a>,
					and his work is simply terrific.
				</li>
				<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">The C Programming Language, Second Edition</a>&mdash;
					Written by the creators of the language itself, this is the
					definitive resource on C.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				In general, the people who ought to be writing books are those that
				work in the FOSS community, and they usually write free books.
				They often offer a paid-for paperback copy, or a means
				to donate/support.
			</p>

		</div>

			<div id="news" class="content">
				<h2>News</h2>
				<p>
					What community would be complete without a means of staying up-to-date?
					Most projects maintain an official blog.

				<div id="how-to" class="content">
					<h2>How-to</h2>

					<p>
						I'd like to take a step back now and consider the process
						of learning Linux itself.
						In my experience, the best method of learning Linux is to focus on the
						underlying concept.
						In view of the quote at the top, I'm not alone in this opinion.
						When the concept is understood, one can usually "feel" one's way through
						rectifying the situation at the command line.
						Let's take an example.
					</p>

					<p>
						Suppose you are working at the command-line, and you have a question about
						copying files.
						Knowing that the command <code>cp</code> copies a file,
						you type <code>man cp</code>, and the manual page appears.
						When you type <code>apropos copy</code>, looking for other
						commands that can copy a file, it shows no results&mdash;
						you know this to be an error, because <code>apropos</code>
						is supposed to search manual pages and list all that
						match "copy," which would certainly include <code>cp</code>.
					</p>

					<ol class="big-list" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
						<li>
							<i>Figure out what your question is.</i>
							<p>
								Initially, your question might be <em>Why doesn't this work?</em>&mdash;
								and that's totally fine.
								Figuring out your question can be more difficult than you might guess,
								because you might not know how to phrase it.
								Try to be specific:
								When dealing with computers, things are <em>very</em> precisely defined.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<i>What would answer your question?</i>
							<p>
								This strikes you as such an obvious error
								that any reasonable documentation should answer your question,
								and you would be right.
								So, you first look into the man pages, with
								<code>man apropos</code>.
							</p>

							<p>
								There, you discover that <code>apropos</code> doesn't search the man
								pages <em>directly,</em> but instead searches a database of information
								about them (it does this because it's much faster).
								Reasonably, you suspect that there might be an error with this database,
								such as, <em>It doesn't exist</em>.
							</p>

							<p>
								A little further down the page, you read,
								"The database searched by <code>apropos</code> is updated by <code>mandb</code>.
								You try <code>mandb</code>, and voila! <code>apropos</code> works as it should.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<i>Be Patient.</i>

							<p>
								Databases like this pop up in other
								contexts, as well.  For instance, in package management, a common
								practice is to maintain a local database about available packages, so that
								the user can search for packages without bothering public servers.
								As such, updating these databases (on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint, with <code>apt update</code>)
								is a precursive step to obtaining the latest packages.
							</p>

							<p>
								The point here is that you should take the time to try to
								learn underlying concepts, because it usually pays off in the long run.
								Skill accrues. Answer one question at a time.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>
						By far, the worst habit to get into is expecting to be spoon-fed solutions as though
						by technical support.
						Imagine, for a second, that you had *instantly* appealed to
						Google, and there you found a response such as,
						"Just run mandb."
						This is correct, and it solves your problem, but you've learned nothing, and
						if you continue "learning" this way, you'll be stuck memorizing trivial idioms.
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>Linux is written by programmers, for programmers.</em>
						It is very pure with respect to computer science, and being a competent user
						necessarily requires some CS know-how.
						If you're not interested in learning that, then find somewhere else to go&mdash;
						but if you are interested, stick around!
					</p>
