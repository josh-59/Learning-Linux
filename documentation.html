	<p>
		Linux is a very large subject.
		Although there are many sources of documentation, they are not,
		in general, well-organized, so that finding the right information
		can be hard.
		This makes good information harder-won than it ought to be,
		and implies that finding good (i.e., appropriate) sources  is a skill in itself.
	</p>

	<p>
		This paper gives an overview of available resources,
		some examples of each, and useful pointers, where appropriate.
		First, though, we make explicit the process of determining appropriate sources.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="how-to" class="content">
	<h2>How-to</h2>

	<p>
		Suppose you are working at the command-line, and you have a question about
		copying files.
		Knowing that the command <code>cp</code> copies a file,
		you type <code>man cp</code>, and the manual page appears.
		When you type <code>apropos copy</code>, looking for other
		commands that can copy a file, it shows no results&mdash;
		you know this to be an error, because <code>apropos</code>
		is supposed to search manual pages and list all that
		match "copy".
	</p>

	<ol class="big-list" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
		<li>
			<i>Figure out what your question is.</i>
			<p>
				Initially, your question might be <em>Why this no work,</em>
				and that's totally fine.
				Figuring out your question can be more difficult than you might guess,
				because you might not know how to phrase it.
				Try to be specific:
				When dealing with computers, things are <em>very</em> precisely defined.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<i>What would answer your question?</i>
			<p>
				This strikes you as such an obvious error
				that any reasonable documentation should answer your question
				(and you would be right).
				So, you first look into the man pages, with
				<code>man apropos</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
				There, you discover that <code>apropos</code> doesn't search the man
				pages <em>directly,</em> but instead searches a database of information
				about them (it does this because it's much faster).
				Reasonably, you suspect that there might be an error with this database
				(such as, it doesn't exist).
			</p>

			<p>
				A little further down the page, you read,
				"The database searched by <code>apropos</code> is updated by <code>mandb</code>.
				You run the program, and voila! <code>apropos</code> works as it should.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Revise.</i>
			<p>
				Do you need more information? Or less?
				Should it be a simpler source, or more involved?
				You might find that your practical knowledge is
				lacking some kind of <i>body</i>; in this case, you are
				looking to frame your knowledge in a more-general theory.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Be Patient.</i>
			<p>
				Databases like this pop up in other
				contexts, as well.  For instance, in package management, a common
				practice is to maintain a local database of package metadata, so that
				the user can search for packages without bothering public servers.
				As such, updating these databases (on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint, with <code>apt update</code>)
				is a precursive step to obtaining the latest packages.
			</p>

			<p>
				The point here is that you should try to take the time
				to learn underlying concepts, because it usually pays off in the long run.
				Skill accrues. Answer one question at a time.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		By far, the worst habit to get into is expecting to be spoon-fed solutions as though
		by technical support.
		Imagine, for a second, that you had *instantly* appealed to
		Google, and there you found a response such as,
		"Just run <code>mandb</code>."
		This is correct, and it solves your problem, but you've learned nothing, and
		if you continue "learning" this way, you'll be stuck memorizing trivial idioms.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>Linux is written by programmers, for programmers.</em>
		It is very pure with respect to computer science, and being a competent user
		necessarily requires some CS know-how.
		If you're not interested in learning that, then find somewhere else to go
		(but if you are interested, stick around!).
	</p>
</div>

<div id="man-pages" class="content">
	<h2> Man Pages </h2>
	<p>
		By far the most useful asset in the Linux documentation pool is the
		manual ("man") pages.
		Man pages date back to the first implementations of Unix,<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html">[1]</a></sup>
		where they were the user's primary documentation of the newly-minted operating system.
		They often included examples, hints and useful suggestions, such as,
		<a href="http://man.cat-v.org/unix-1st/1/cat">"<em>cat file</em> is about the easiest way to print a file."</a>
	</p>

	<p>
		Today, the man pages are <a href="http://www.man7.org/">maintained by Michael Kerrisk,</a>
		and often include examples, hints, and useful suggestions,
		such as, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getdents.2.html">"These are not the interfaces you are interested in.</a>"
		Learn to use man pages early, for they are a way of life.
	</p>

	<div class="aside-right" style="margin-left: 25pt; padding-bottom: 0">
		<h4>Manual Sections:</h4>
		<ol style="margin-left:0">
			<li> Shell Commands </li>
			<li> Systems Calls </li>
			<li> C Library Functions </li>
			<li> Special Files </li>
			<li> File Formats and Conventions </li>
			<li> Games </li>
			<li> Miscellaneous</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<p>
		Man pages are accessed at the command line so:
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		man app
	</div>

	<p>
		You can search through available man pages with the <code>apropos</code> command,
		as in,
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		apropos decompress
	</div>

	<p>
		or
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		apropos extract
	</div>

	<p>
		Technically speaking, this utility searches the single-line, "short description"
		of each man page, and prints out the names and descriptions of programs that match your search
		(<code><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/apropos.1.html">man apropos</a></code> for more information).
	</p>

	<p>
		Once within the <code>man</code> utility, you can easily search the content
		by typing a forward slash, then your search term:
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		/&lt;search-term&gt;
	</div>

	<p>
		Then, <em>enter</em>.  To jump to the next result, type a single <b>n</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Many of the controls of the man-pages coincide with those of
		the <code>less</code> paging utility, and the <code>vim</code>
		text editor, so they're worth learning.
		For instance, to move down one line, type <b>j</b>.
		To move up one line, type <b>k</b>.
		And, move down a screenful by hitting the spacebar.
		Why the crazy controls?  It keeps your fingers on the home row.
	</p>

	<p>
		The manual is structured into sections, as shown above.
		In particular, Section 1 contains entries for user commands,
		such as <code>cat</code>, <code>man</code>, <code>mv</code> and <code>cp</code>,
		while Section 3 contains the manual pages for C library functions, such as
		<code>getline()</code>, <code>printf()</code> and <code>strtol()</code>.
		When using <code>apropos</code>, one can restrict the search to a particular section with the <code>-s</code> switch:
	</p>

	<div class="code">
		apropos -s 3 printf
	</div>

	<p>
		Otherwise, <code>apropos</code> lists them all.
	</p>

	<p>
		In addition, each manual page is organized into
		a common format.
		For instance, each page has a "See Also" section near the bottom,
		which lists related commands/library functions.
	</p>

	<h3>See Also:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html">man(1)</a></li>
	</ul>

</div>

<div id="official-documentation" class="content">
	<h2> Official Documentation </h2>

	<p>
		Official documentation originates from the group or organization
		that is producing the work; it is part of the project itself.
		It is suitably positioned to be both exhaustive and authoritative over the subject.
		Think of offical documentation like the
		<a href="https://primarysources.yale.edu/"> primary sources </a>
		from history class.
	</p>

	<p>
		In some sense this is the only form of true "documentation," properly speaking;
		everything else is commentary.
		Like the projects they are part of, official documentation is usually
		community-driven.
		Moreover, it is typically found in web-page format.
	</p>

	<p>
		Several examples spring to mind:
	</p>
	<ul class="big-list">
		<li>
			<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/"> The Linux Kernel Documentation</a>&mdash;
			A book-like documenting the latest kernel.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/"> Arch Linux's Wiki</a>&mdash;
			The official documentation of the Arch distribution.
			This is an excellent resource, and its material often applies to distributions outside of Arch.
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href="https://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html"> GNU's Official Docs</a>&mdash;
			Excellent documentation. It is both supremely authoritative and exhaustive,
			but owing to its precision, and the precision of the work they do, it can be
			difficult to read.  Also, note that they offer (the same) documentation in multiple
			formats: HTML, PDF, and through their own <code>info(1)</code> utility.
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Open Source Game Engine</a>&mdash;
			Godot is an MIT-licensed open source game engine.
			Its <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/">official documentation</a> is community-driven.
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">
				The Rust Progamming Language</a>&mdash;
				A book written by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols with updates from the community,
				this is part of the official documentation of the Rust language.
				I think it's very well-written, especially notable for its
				technical excellence.
			</li>
		</ul>

	</div>

	<div id="unofficial-documentation" class="content">
		<h2> Unofficial Documentation </h2>
		<p>
			Most documentation is from unofficial, secondary sources.
			Examples include this website, blogs, question/answer sites,
			Youtube videos, podcasts, books, etc..
		</p>

		<p>
			Think of unofficial documentation as commentary on the subject at hand.
			It can be useful when the subject is difficult (for instance, Bash),
			but official documentation should still be considered your reference.
		</p>

		<p>
			Examples of good, unofficial documentation:
		</p>

		<ul class="big-list">
			<li>
				<a href="http://tldp.org/"> The Linux Documentation Project</a>&mdash;
				This is very close to being official documentation, in virtue of the
				nature of the community that created Linux.
				However, it is not officially coupled to any project, and so is
				best considered a secondary source.
				Moreover, its scope is larger than the kernel.
				TLDP is not maintained anymore,
				so that its content is often out of date (but still very good).
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://debian-handbook.info/"> Debian Administrator's Handbook</a>&mdash;
				A free book written by Raphaël Hertzog and Roland Mas, two Debian developers,
				it was originally written in French, and has been translated into
				four other languages, with twenty(!) more in-progress.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/"> Linux From Scratch </a>&mdash;
				From their website, "Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides
				you with step-by-step instructions for building your own customized
				Linux system entirely from source."<sup><a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/index.html">[2]</a></sup>
				It's a thing.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Note:  GNU/Linux is an open-source community; respect it by avoiding
			commercial (.com) sites that "offer" advice and documentation about Linux.
			Also, StackOverflow is not the appropriate avenue for bug reports.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="content" id="nf-books">
		<h2>Nonfree Books</h2>
		<p>
			In the main, I recommend staying away from non-free *nix books.
			There are several reasons for this.
		</p>

		<p>
			First, there's just too many of them, and very few are worthwhile.
			For instance, I bought a handbook on UNIX system administration
			that looked very promising, but taught me precious little.
			In fact, the free <a href="https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/">Debian Administrator's Handbook</a>
			proved a more succinct, more direct and more appropriate resource.
		</p>

		<div class="aside-right">
			<h4>Aside:</h4>
			<p>
				My aim here is to warn the reader, not to make light of other peoples'
				work.
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			Second, non-free books are almost always secondary sources, and hence not authoritative;
			moreover, there's a good chance that the one you try will not be the best
			resource.
		</p>

		<p>
			Third, they tend to be *somewhat* out-of-date.
			For example, I really liked the premise of
			<a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Molay-Understanding-UNIX-LINUX-Programming-A-Guide-to-Theory-and-Practice/PGM190781.html">
				Understanding UNIX/LINUX Programming: A Guide to Theory and Practice</a>.
				It walks you through programming in Linux by recreating
				common command-line tools, such as <code>cat(1)</code> and <code>ls(1)</code>, but it
				was so out-of-date by the time I read it that the information in it couldn't be trusted.
				It'd be great to see this rewritten in a modern context.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some exceptions:
			</p>

			<ul class="big-list">
				<li> <a href="https://www.man7.org/tlpi/index.html">The Linux Programming Interface</a>&mdash;
					This is the definitive text on the programming interface
					of the Linux Kernel.
					If you want all the gory details of the system-call interface offered
					by the Linux kernel, as well as sound explanations of its
					internals, this is your book.
					Its writer, Michael Kerrisk, is currently the maintainer of the
					<a href="http://www.man7.org/">Linux Man Page project</a>,
					and his work is simply terrific.
				</li>
				<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">The C Programming Language, Second Edition</a>&mdash;
					Written by the creators of the language itself, this is the
					definitive resource on C.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				In general, the people who ought to be writing books are those that
				work in the FOSS community, and those people usually write free books.
				They often offer a paid-for paperback copy, or other means
				to donate.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div id="tutorials" class="content">
			<h2> Tutorials </h2>

			<p>
				Tutorials are a great form of documentation,
				because they are informative, concise, and relevant.
				A tutorial jumps right in to the subject at hand.
			</p>

			<p>
				Good examples of good tutorials:
				<ul class="big-list">
					<li>
						<a href="https://youtu.be/mAbG8Oi-SvQ"> Make an Action RPG in Godot 3.2</a>&mdash;
						A Youtube tutorial for building your own Godot 3.2 game.
					</li>

					<li>
						<a href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com"> Learn Markdown</a>&mdash;

						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="news" class="content">
				<h2>News</h2>
				<p>
					What community would be complete without a means of staying up-to-date?
					Most projects maintain an official blog.
