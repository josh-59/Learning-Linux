    <h2>Pinebook Pro</h2>
    <h4>June 2020</h4>
    <p>
        After reading the 
        <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/pinebook-pro-review-a-200-foss-to-the-hilt-magnesium-chassis-laptop/">Ars Technica review of this exact same unit</a>, and finding it disagreeable in several regards, I felt compelled to write my own review.
        For those who don't know, the
        <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro">Pinebook Pro</a> is an open-source alternative to 
        Chromebooks.  
        It's got a 14", 1080p display, a system-on-a-chip hex-core processor with 4 gigabytes of RAM, and ships with 64 gigabytes of flash-storage.
        A custom Manjaro build is preinstalled, which I am running now. 
        At $200, I think it's a capable, well-built Chromebook alternative.

        First, the screen.  
        I have had no trouble with the screen whatsoever.
        In fact, I think its size is great, and the full-HD resolution ideal.
        The screen has not 'burnt in', as it had at Ars (but if it does, I will update this review).
        In addition, the screen is not 'dim'; at full brightness, it actually begins to white-out.
    </p>

        After the screen, the second most important part of a laptop is probably its keyboard.
        Keyboard is fine, though unambiguosly cheap.
        Each strike has a plastic-y kind of sound, and when I first started using it, I found that it would double-read a keypress.
        I'd hit 'k', for instance, and wind up with 'kk'.
        This has been alleviated with use/familiarization.
        The keyboard is not backlit.

        When I first got the unit running, the trackpad acted <em>weird</em>.  
        It would tend to drift; I could not hold the cursor still, with my finger on the trackpad.
        It was so bad, in fact, that I fiddled around with settings in Manjaro related to cursor acceleration and whitenoise, but
        to no avail.
        Well, as it turns out, the trackpad was shipped with this transparent <em>sticker</em>, and the sticker had air underneathe it.  
        As I used the machine, the sticker began to darken near the center; taking this as a cue, I pressed the rest of the 'air'
        out, and it's been working amiably since.
        The reviewers at Ars Technica forcibly removed this sticker, and damaged the trackpad as a result; don't do that.
        Beyond that minor hiccup, it's a fine trackpad&mdash; size is perfect; left/right clicky-clicks; multitouch works out of the box.
    </p>

        A notable feature is the existence of so-called 
        <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php?title=Pinebook_Pro#Privacy_Switches">"Privacy Mode" switches</a>.
        Built into the keyboard's firmware is the ability to control power to 1) Webcam 2) Wifi 3) Microphone.
        No more tape!
        Instead, you hold down the Pine key and press F10-F12, and the caps-lock lights blink to tell you 
        if power is on or off for a specific accessory. 
        This is not connected to the operating system, so it's as secure as a physical toggle.
        No more tape!

        I like the Pinebook Pro, but then, I want to like it.
        It is a very useable, very liveable laptop.
        I have had no trouble editing my websites, building/serving them with Jekyll, and viewing them with Firefox,
        simultaneously, on it; under this workload, the machine uses 1.5GB of the available 3.7GB of RAM.
        And, the battery life is insane-- 10,000mAh yields something like six(?) solid hours.
