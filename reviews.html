    <h2>Pinebook Pro</h2>
    <h4>June 2020</h4>
    <p>
        After reading the
        <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/pinebook-pro-review-a-200-foss-to-the-hilt-magnesium-chassis-laptop/">Ars Technica review of the Pinebook Pro</a>, and finding it disagreeable in several regards, I felt compelled to write my own.
        For those who don't know, the
        <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro">Pinebook Pro</a> is intended to
        be an open-source and natively-Linux alternative to buying a Chromebook and installing Linux on it.
        It's got a 14", 1080p display, a system-on-a-chip hex-core processor with 4 gigabytes of RAM, and ships with 64 gigabytes of flash-storage.
        A custom Manjaro build is preinstalled, which I am running now.
        At $200, I think that if you intend to buy a Chromebook to install Linux on it,
        that this is a better alternative.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Screen:</strong> First, the screen.
        I have had no trouble with the screen whatsoever.
        In fact, I think its size is great, and the full-HD resolution ideal.
        The screen has not 'burnt in', as it had at Ars (but if it does, I will update this review).
        In addition, the screen is not 'dim'; at full brightness, it actually begins to white-out.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Keyboard:</strong> After the screen, the second most important part of a laptop is, to me, the keyboard.
        The Pinebook Pro's keyboard is fine, though unambiguosly cheap.
        Each strike has a plastic-y kind of sound, and when I first started using it, I found that it would double-read a keypress.
        I'd hit 'k', for instance, and wind up with 'kk'.
        This has been alleviated with use/familiarization.
        The keyboard is not backlit.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Trackpad:</strong> When I first got the unit running, the trackpad acted <em>weird</em>.
        The cursor would tend to drift, whenever my finger was on the trackpad.
        It was so bad, in fact, that I fiddled around with settings in Manjaro related to cursor acceleration and whitenoise, but
        to no avail.
        Well, as it turns out, the trackpad was shipped with a transparent sticker, and the sticker had air underneathe it.
        As I used the machine, the sticker began to darken near the center; taking this as a cue, I pressed the rest of the 'air'
        out, and it's been working amiably since.
        The reviewers at Ars Technica forcibly removed this sticker, and damaged the trackpad as a result; don't do that.
        Beyond that minor hiccup, it's a fine trackpad&mdash; size is perfect; left/right clicky-clicks; multitouch works out of the box.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Privacy Mode Switches:</strong>
        A notable feature is the existence of so-called
        <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php?title=Pinebook_Pro#Privacy_Switches">"Privacy Mode" switches</a>.
        Built into the keyboard's firmware is the ability to control power to 1) Webcam 2) Wifi 3) Microphone.
        No more tape!
        Instead, you hold down the Pine key and press F10-F12, and the caps-lock lights blink to tell you
        if power is on or off for a specific accessory.
        This is not connected to the operating system, so it's as secure as a physical toggle.
        No more tape!
    </p>

        <strong>Battery:</strong>
        The Pinebook Pro ships with a 10,000 mAh battery.
        Combined with the 14" screen and power-sipping hardware, this is enough to last
        six hours, easily (I have not tested it).
        However, I have found that it does not sleep correctly when the lid is closed; you must turn it off
        properly, or the battery will drain.
    <p>

    <p>
        <strong>Issues:</strong>
        I did come across some issues with the Pinebook Pro.
        First, the wifi did, indeed, stop working&mdash; specifically, it failed to recognize 5GHz connections.
        Other networks were recognized and worked fine.
        Second, the audio is very quiet.
        With headphones, the audio is useable, but quiet.
        I tried cranking it past 100%, but this only induced amplifier static.
        None of these issues have been critical, and so I have not looked into any of them.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
        In all, I really like the Pinebook Pro.
        I have found it to be a very useable, very liveable laptop.
        It isn't as mature a product as a comparable Chromebook; as such, it's best suited to
        tinkerers and early-adopters.
