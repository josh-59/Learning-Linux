    <h1>Package Management </h1>

    <p>
        A package is a bundle of data that contains the things 
        required to implement a program, a set of related programs,
        or a set of related features.<sup><a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging/Intro">[1]</a></sup>
        It contains the primary binary executable, other assets required
        by it, a description of the software included, and 
        a list of other dependancies (if any).
        Packages provide a way to automate the 
        installation of software,<sup><a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging/Intro">[1]</a></sup>
        and exist in multiple contexts within the FOSS domain.

    <h2> Introduction to Packages  </h2>

    <p>
        I think packages will make the most sense if we just jump right in to
        using them.
        So, there's a piece of software that I really like, but which is
        not available on the official Debian repositories.
        It's the <a href="https://atom.io">Atom text editor</a>:
    </p>

        <a href="assets/img/atom.png"><img style="width: 100%" src=assets/img/atom.png></a>
        <figcaption><center><b>Atom</b></center></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Although there is <a href=https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/">a way</a> to add Atom's repository to Debian systems,
        I never do (shame on me!).
        Instead, I usually just download the <code>.deb</code> package given on the landing
        of their website, and install it manually, which goes like this:
    </p>

    <p>
        Clicking the link downloads a single file, <code>atom-amd64.deb</code>, which is
        the package.
        From here, open a terminal in the containing folder and
        install it with,
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        sudo apt install ./atom-amd64.deb
    </div>

    <p>
        That's it. There's nothing more to it.
    </p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>

    <p>
        On other operating systems, it is common to download an executable file,
        then execute it, to install new software.
        Centralized software management offers a few advantages over
        this design:
    </p>

    <ol class="big-list">
        <li>
            Eliminating Repeated Code
            <p>
                Packages eliminate the need to include an installation 
                solution, since they abdicate this to a utility
                (here, <code>apt</code>).
                In software development, repition is not only avoided,
                it is also discouraged.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            More Controlled Installation
            <p>
                <code>apt</code> controls where each file is
                placed.  
                Thereby, a uniformity across the system may be maintained.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Centralized Updating
            <p>
                Typically, all of the software on a system is managed
                by the package manager.
                Thereby, all of the software on a system (that is, the
                system itself) may be kept up-to-date by a single utility.
            </p>

<div class="content" id="repositories">
    <h2>Repositories</h2>
    <p>
        Collections of packages are called <em>repositories,</em> or
        sometimes, <em>archives.</em>
        A repository may be remote (the usual case), or it may be local
        (e.g., on a thumb-drive).
    </p>

    <p>
        A repository belonging to a large project, such as Debian's,
        is often mirrored by other organizations.
