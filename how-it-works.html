    Notes:
        The term <em>open source</em> describes the way that software
        is distributed and used, not to how it is produced.

        So what makes it all tick?
        In this dramatic conclusion, we'll pick apart the
        key components of the open-source ecosystem,
        from the motivations of contributors to the leadership
        style necessarily implied by them.

    <h2>An Analogy</h2>

    <p>
        Let's start by ignoring the actual <em>software</em> part of
        open source, and consider another ecosystem that produces
        free works: 3D Printing.
        The 3D printing community is composed principally (but not
        exclusively) of hobbiests,
        whom share plans in much the same way that the
        open-source ecosystem shares source.
    </p>


            Cute Kirby Fume Extractor
            https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4865478
                ++Creative Commons

    <p>
        The typical plan is not sophisticated, and is principally
        a creative endeavor. 
        About this, economist ______ Weber says,
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "Human beings often have a passionate relationship to their
        creative endeavors and their work; they wish to share
        their creativity with others; and value inheres in
        things other than monetizable rewards.  Each of these
        attitudes exists within the open source community."<sup><a href="#references" title="Weber p10">[g]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>
   
    <p>
        In contrast to the maker community, open source is older,
        has produced much more sophisticated entities through
        much larger cooperative efforts, and is
        comparatively well-studied.
        We have found that most people do not contribute, 
        and even those that do contribute tend to contribute just
        once or twice.
    </p>

<div class="content" id="organizational-structures">
    <h2>Organizational Structures</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Recall that <em>open source</em> is a synonym for
            <em>free software.</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Properly speaking, open-source describes only how
        software is distributed and used&mdash; Not how it is produced.
        Notably, it requires human-readable "source" be made available 
        alongside machine-readable instructions, and 
        that software be redistributable by any user.
    </p>

    <p>
        In particular, the organizational structure adopted to produce
        this software is not restricted, and
        many open-source projects are <em>not</em> open to collaboration.
        For example, GNU is not collaborative:
        While users are permitted to
        modify and redistribute the project's works, those modifications 
        were never intended to make their way back into GNU source,
        and they usually do not.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hence, there is a deliberate delineation between <em>user</em> and 
        <em>developer.</em>
        The GNU project sets itself apart from other non-profit organizations
        in that its products are made impactful in virtue of their
        low "marginal" cost:
        It costs very little to create another copy, and 
        thereby support another user.
    </p>

    <h3>Collaborative Open Source</h3>
    
    <p>
        When Linus Torvalds invited any interested hacker to
        tinker on his kernel, he invented a new
        way of making free software.
        The result was "Accidentally Revolutionary," and has
        dominated open-source since.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within his project, the heavy lifting is
        carried out by user-contributors&mdash; People who,
        having a desire, implement it themselves,
        then make the change available back to its source.
        It should be noted that there is no "rule" that collaboration
        be restricted to hobbyists.
        Facebook, for example, has put considerable effort
        into Linux's new <code>btrfs</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Collaborative open-source blurs the line between "user"
        and "developer": You can get as involved as you want.
        In practice, most contributors are casual, offering just
        one or two changes, with a relatively small cadre
        tasking themselves with ensuring project coherence.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="organizing-work">
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Organizing Work:</h2>
    <h4>Bazaar Style</h4>

    <p>
        The open-source ecosystem has naturally
        decomposed into projects, with people working on what they want.
        Without the clear external motivation of money, 
        collaborative open source is said to be
        <em>intrinsically motivated:</em>
        They are carried out because what they are <em>is</em> what their 
        creators want.
    </p>

    <p>
        While we may wish to think that each project is a paradigm
        of virtue and cooperation, this is in fact not the case.
        Public desire is not homogenous, and, especially in large
        projects, the role of project leader can quickly skew from 
        <em>lead developer</em> to <em>modification curator.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the key point, and the primary difference between 
        Linus' model and every other way of working:
        In collaborative open-source, work is submitted <em>by users,</em>
        inspected on a case-by-case basis, 
        and then either accepted into the project or rejected.
        Project leaders take on the responsibility of the work's 
        overall well-being, and foster its development by
        sifting through (and modifying) proposed modifications.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>
            The term <em>maintainer</em> is usually used to refer to
            project leader.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        So, while individuals are, in theory, 
        empowerd to shape a project into what they want, 
        in practice these modifications are moderated by the project's
        maintainers.
        Given significant difference of opinion, users 
        can always fork the source repository and lead
        a sister project in their preferred direction.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even supposing perfect cooperation, many disconnected but well-meaning 
        contributors work in parallel, not in concert&mdash; 
        they're each modifying the same sheet, essentially.
        Consequently, small changes are much preferred, with
        the result being highly evolutionary, and rarely revolutionary, 
        improvement.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within Linus' project, those dedicated maintainers 
        form of a "tree of trust" to handle code review and commit acceptance:
        Each edit suggested by someone outside the group
        filters up towards the more seniour developers, on their way
        to being accepted.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/FqWLbjov-bQ">evolutionary</a> 
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="content" id="time-based-releases">
    <h2>Time-based Releases</h2>

    <p>
        Large collaborative projects, for whom many people want 
        to include changes, often schedule releases.  
        This pattern accomodates both feature introduction and 
        commit rejection: 
        If your new feature doesn't make it into the latest version of 
        Firefox, for instance, you only have to 
        wait six weeks for the next chance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mozilla calls this, "stability without stagnation."<sup><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html">[6]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Another example: Debian Sid
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, the last opportunity to merge feature
        changes in Firefox is before it enters <em>beta</em>.
        In beta, merges are restricted to bug fixes and 
        security updates. 
        Each release spends four weeks in <em>beta</em>
        before being released as the current official Firefox version.
    </p>

    <p>
        While it is being used by the public, merges 
        are again restricted to bug fixes and
        security updates, and, again, each release
        is supported for four weeks:
    </p>

    <figure>
        <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar">
            <img src="assets/img/firefox-train-schedule.png" style="width: 90%; padding-bottom: 10pt;">
        </a>
        <figcaption><center><b><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar">Firefox Release Schedule</a></b></center></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Witin Mozilla, this is known as a "train schedule,"
        and we see that <em>Firefox 80</em> will be released as 
        <em>Firefox 81</em>
        enters Beta and <em>Firefox 82</em> enters Nightly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Firefox is one of the largest and most agressive of
        open-source projects&mdash;
        It even spawned the (awesome) programming language, Rust.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's take a step back from the organization of large
        projects, and consider the success of one that is much smaller.

    <h4>A Success Story</h4>

    <p>
        A <em>paging utility</em> is a program that displays a file on 
        the terminal one screenful at a time.
        The first widely used paging utility was <code>more</code>, written by
        Dan Halbert as a graduate student at UC Berkley in 1978.<sup><a href="https://danhalbert.org/more.html">[aa]</a></sup>
        <code>more</code> is a relatively simple program: It first 
        fills up the screen, then waits for user input to print the 
        next line(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1983, Mark Nudelman was a software developer working for a
        company called Integrated Office Systems. From the <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#history"><code>less</code> FAQ</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Some of our software ran on a Unix system and produced enormous log files
        of its transactions. We wanted to be able to search these log files for
        error messages. But the version of "vi" we were using couldn't handle
        files larger than a certain size, and our log files often exceeded that
        size. So we were forced to use "more" to view the files. The problem was,
        once we found an error message, what we really wanted to see was the
        transactions leading up to the error; that is, the lines in the log file
        immediately before the error message. But more didn't allow backward
        movement in the file.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        We often complained about this problem. We said we needed a "backwards
        more"; someone (it wasn't me, but unfortunately I don't remember who
        it was) coined the name "less" as a joke on the concept of a "backwards
        more". It didn't seem to me that it would be too difficult to write a
        simple pager that would allow forward and backward movement.
        I wrote the first version in late 1983 and we began using it internally.
        I continued to enhance it and finally decided it was a useful enough
        tool that I should make it available to the world. I posted the first
        version to the newsgroup called (at that time) net.sources in May, 1985.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Making the program publicly available allowed an enormous number of
        people to use it. Many people have made their own modifications and
        donated them to me for incorporation into the official version, and
        many more have reported bugs they've found or made suggestions about
        features they'd like to see added. This was my first experience with
        the concept of what is now called "open source" or "free software",
        and it has, I believe, produced a very high quality product. I'd like
        to thank all the users of less for their invaluable comments and
        suggestions over the years. 
        Less wouldn't be what it is today without you.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Mark Nudelman continues to maintain the project today.  
        It is, at the time of this writing, in its 581<sup>st</sup> 
        version.<sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#version">[q]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/index.html">[r]</a></sup>

    <h2>Working in Open Source</h2>

    <p>
        Open-source is a strange beast:
        Its works were built at the behest of their creators.
        Counterintuitively, those that are most successful and enduring
        are carried out for their own sake.

        Apparently, she thought that Redox OS would be the next big

        a better place.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Do what you Want.</u> 
    </p>

    <p>
        Especially in the case of large projects, 
        one can expect to find that they are not alone in their
        desire for it. 
        The consequence is both appreciation for the work, and if
        it is large enough to require collaboration, collaboration.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Make it work first, then make it work better,</u>
        From filesystems to operating systems...
        Even Linus Torvalds started off writing <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>
        on his 386.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Do one thing and do it well.</u>
        Precisely state your project's goal.
    </p>

    <p>
        The most important component is 
        <em>reiterative improvement.</em>

<div class="content" id="a-sport">
    <h2>A Sport</h2>

    <p>
        To call open-source a hobby isn't quite strong enough. 
        At the same time, it isn't <em>work</em> in the 
        traditional sense, either.  
        I think it's somewhere between the two, closer to sport.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most people can make a program work&mdash; and programming is a
        great hobby and a useful skill&mdash; but the software that
        actually gets used on a daily basis (e.g., Bash) 
        is extremely sophisticated.
        These projects are shepherded by talented and educated
        individuals, whom are professionals of their field.
        The magic is that they make the things they do because they
        want to.
    </p>

    <p>
        Code and money are not the only ways to support your
        favorite open-source project, and I would encourage you
        to help in any way you can. 
        Detailed bug reports, if you find them.
        More, I would encourage you to find something <em>you</em> want
        to do, and make it happen.
