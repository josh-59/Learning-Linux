        So what makes it all tick?
        In this dramatic conclusion, we'll pick apart the
        key components of the open-source ecosystem,
        from the motivations of contributors to the leadership
        style necessarily implied by them.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="intrinsic-motivation">
    <h2>Intrinsic Motivation</h2>

    <p>
        Compared to the market economy we all know and love, 
        open source is a strange beast:
        Its works are created because what they 
        are <em>is</em> what their creators want.
        Stated another way, the intent of all free software is 
        the software itself.
        Such goods, produced for their own sake, are said
        to be <em>intrinsically motivated,</em> and 
        this underpins the open-source ecosystem.
        Intrinsic motivation is found in many other places, 
        such as academic research and artistic works set on 
        public display.
    </p>

    <p>
        Admittedly, we are adopting a very high-level perspective of
        open-source: 
        By analogy, money is the singular motivating entity in the market
        economy.
        And, every contributor to the free software ecosystem has their own
        motivations, and they may well be enjoyment, passion, or idealism.
        But on the whole, I believe that if you look at free software from
        a macro perspective, that intrinsic value is the most important
        motivating force.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Remember:</h4>
        <p>
            <em>We want what it is.</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Contributing to open source can even make
        sound financial sense&mdash; Facebook 
        taking part in the development of 
        Linux's new
        <code><a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">btrfs</a></code> 
        is one such example.
        However, in this case, as in most other cases, 
        the principal interest is in the software <em>per se:</em>
        It is developed to be used, not to be sold, and is therefore
        developed for its intrinsic value.
    </p>

    <p>
        While we may like to think that open-source is
        strictly the work of hobbyists, in practice this isn't the case.
        Since the resulting software may be used for any purpose&mdash;
        including commercial purposes&mdash; it has naturally come
        to pass that some developers intend to profit
        from its use.
        Moreover, open-source is neither charitable nor altruistic.
        Stated more plainly, 
        We are not in the business of pleasing other people.
        We are in the 
        <em>I have an itch and I'm gonna scratch it</em> business.
    </p>

    <p>
        If intrinsic motivation is indeed the principle motivation
        of the open-source ecosystem, as I believe,
        then it would follow that those projects with
        the greatest number of use-cases garner the greatest support.
        In fact, the largest free-software organization to date
        is neither GNU nor Linux, but the 
        <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache Foundation</a>, 
        whose projects underpin the world wide web.

    <h2>Anatomy of a Project</h2>

    <p>
        The typical open-source project is organized around
        a single trusted maintainer. 
        This person is responsible for presenting the
        project to the world, 
        for releasing new versions as they become mature,
        and for staging releases so that they may be worked on.
        To give two examples, 
        the Linux kernel is maintained by Linus Torvalds, and
        the Bourne Again Shell is maintained by 
        Chet Ramey.
        These individuals work diligently over years to earn the
        trust of the community and to produce a mature, stable product.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            An open-source software project without a maintainer 
            is said to be <em>unmaintained.</em> 
            It has been effectively abandoned&mdash;
            or is looking for a maintainer :) .
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Maintainers have the right to modify their work
        however they want:
        They accept modifications as they see fit,
        and they may decline a proposed modification for any 
        reason whatsoever. 
        Modifications are declined so often that 
        project leadership can easily become a matter of curating modifications.
    </p>

    <p>
        In practice, a discussion usually surrounds each modification.
        These discussions can become heated, and conflict is common.
        The accepted standard is to say what you think and to
        not be afraid about disagreeing with others,
        whoever they may be.<sup><a href="references" title="Weber 63">[1]</a></sup>
        At the end of the day, a project's maintainer has the final say over their
        project, and if you don't like it, you are free to fork the
        source repository and lead a new project somewhere different.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em><mark>
        The success of any project, with respect to producing a mature
            and polished product, is contingent principally 
            upon its improvement through long-term evolution.</mark></em>
        It doesn't matter how clever you are, nor how talented you may
        be; what really matters is how willing you are to make sure that
        your job gets done right.
    </p>

    <p>
        Very large projects, like the Linux kernel or the Firefox
        web browser, are broken down into subsystems, which then
        have maintainers of their own.
        Modifications to the project first
        pass through the appropriate subsystem maintainer 
        before being proposed to the project's overarching maintainer;
        modifications can be declined anywhere along the way.

    <h2>Voluntary Selection of Tasks</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            In the Linux kernel, as in Bash and Firefox and 
            most other open-source projects of today, each and every 
            user is invited to submit improvements.
            Thanks to the internet, the result has been
            collaboration on a very large scale.
            To describe this situation, I would like to introduce a new
            term: Massively collaborative.
            A project is <em>massively collaborative</em> if every user is
            welcome to contribute.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The contributors of the open-source community work together in a
        highly parallel and unstructured fashion.<sup><a href="#references" title="Weber">[1]</a></sup>
        Each person is presented with the same core code-base&mdash;
        the project as it exists presently&mdash;
        and can modify it however they desire.
        A project's maintainer may suggest things that could use improvement,
        but no developer is obliged to make those changes, and any user
        can make other modifications.
    </p>

    <p>
        The result is voluntary participation and voluntary selection
        of tasks, and as a model of production, this organizational
        structure defines the open-source process:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <em>The key element of the open source process, as an ideal type,
        is the voluntary participation and voluntary selection of
        tasks.</em>[sic]
        Anyone can join an open source project, and anyone can leave at
        any time.
        That is not just a free market in labor.  
        What makes it different from the theoretical option of exit
        from a corporate organization is this: Each person is free to
        choose what he wishes to work on or to contribute.
        There is no consciously organized or enforced division of labor.<sup><a href="#references" title="Weber">[1]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>


    <p>
        The result is totally decentralized, with 
        very few authorities present. 
        Those that do exist are recognized in virtue of their merit alone.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the truly remarkable things of modern open-source is that
        no one person or organization is responsible for the creation of 
        a GNU/Linux operating system.
        Rather, collecting and assembling the pieces is a project of its
        own, distinct from, say, shell development, itself distinct from,
        say, kernel development.

    <h2>Community</h2>
    <p>
        Open source is built by a community of like-minded
        actors, and community is a highly underrated aspect of
        successful open-source.
        It is the community that produced the software, the community which
        supports it, and the community that uses it.
    </p>

    <p>
        To me, the magic of open source is that it's composed of works
        people created because they wanted to.
        Nobody is collecting your data, and nobody is getting rich.
        It's just good things made for their own sake&mdash;
        and that's enough for me.
        These projects are shepherded by talented and educated
        individuals, professionals of their respective fields, 
        who volunteered their time to create these things, and
        I think that they, and their works, are awesome.
    </p>

    <p>
        Open source is a highly social way of working.
        Community emerges dynamically as projects get their feet under
        them; communities grow around some shared goal, and are not born.  
        Apache Software Foundation member Ted Dunning explains:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "We as people come together; we have some communal interest.
        As such, we build a structure together that allows us to work
        together, allows us to communicate, allows us to bring in new people,
        and build software together.
        This is definitely not the fastest way to build software, but
        it's a remarkably sustainable way."

    <h4>A Success Story</h4>

    <p>
        A paging utility is a program that displays a file on 
        a terminal one screenful at a time.
        The first widely used paging utility was <code>more</code>, written by
        Dan Halbert as a graduate student at UC Berkeley in 1978.<sup><a href="https://danhalbert.org/more.html">[2]</a></sup>
        <code>more</code> is a simple program: It first 
        fills up the screen, then waits for user input to print the 
        next line(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1983, Mark Nudelman was a software developer working for a
        company called Integrated Office Systems. From the <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#history"><code>less</code> FAQ</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Some of our software ran on a Unix system and produced enormous log files
        of its transactions. We wanted to be able to search these log files for
        error messages. But the version of "vi" we were using couldn't handle
        files larger than a certain size, and our log files often exceeded that
        size. So we were forced to use "more" to view the files. The problem was,
        once we found an error message, what we really wanted to see was the
        transactions leading up to the error; that is, the lines in the log file
        immediately before the error message. But more didn't allow backward
        movement in the file.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        We often complained about this problem. We said we needed a "backwards
        more"; someone (it wasn't me, but unfortunately I don't remember who
        it was) coined the name "less" as a joke on the concept of a "backwards
        more". It didn't seem to me that it would be too difficult to write a
        simple pager that would allow forward and backward movement.
        I wrote the first version in late 1983 and we began using it internally.
        I continued to enhance it and finally decided it was a useful enough
        tool that I should make it available to the world. I posted the first
        version to the newsgroup called (at that time) net.sources in May, 1985.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Making the program publicly available allowed an enormous number of
        people to use it. Many people have made their own modifications and
        donated them to me for incorporation into the official version, and
        many more have reported bugs they've found or made suggestions about
        features they'd like to see added. This was my first experience with
        the concept of what is now called "open source" or "free software",
        and it has, I believe, produced a very high quality product. I'd like
        to thank all the users of less for their invaluable comments and
        suggestions over the years. 
        Less wouldn't be what it is today without you.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Mark Nudelman continues to maintain the project today.  
        It is, at the time of this writing, in its 581<sup>st</sup> 
        version.<sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#version">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/index.html">[4]</a></sup>
