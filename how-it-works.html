    <h2>How To Contribute</h2>

    <p>
        <u>Do what you Want.</u> 
        When one wants for a thing, it is usually the case that
        others want for the same (like the various browsers 
        mentioned above).
        The consequence is both appreciation for the work, and if
        the project is large, collaboration.
        This is how things get built in open-source:
        Some guy (or gal) wants some <em>thing</em> and makes it, then
        makes it available to others, and presto, we've got it.
    </p>


    <p>
        <u>Do one thing and do it well.</u>
        Consistent, dilligent, long-term improvement is far more
        important than initial quality.
        Free software lends itself well to this largely because
        software development is highly reiterative anyway.
        While implicit motivation is, admittedly, slower than its
        monetary counterparts, it has proved to 
        produce higher-quality works in the long term:
        Open-source code is <em>always</em> up for review, correction
        and improvement.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Release Early, Release Often.</u>
        Many disconnected but well-meaning contributors work in parallel, 
        not concert&mdash; 
        they're each modifying the same sheet, essentially.
        More, without the direction offered by a boss, 
        open-source works in an unstructured fashion.
        Releasing often is a friendly way to keep everyone on the
        same sheet.

        The term <em>open source</em> describes the way that software
        is distributed and used, not to how it is produced.

        So what makes it all tick?
        In this dramatic conclusion, we'll pick apart the
        key components of the open-source ecosystem,
        from the motivations of contributors to the leadership
        style necessarily implied by them.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="ownership">
    <h2>Ownership in Open-Source</h2>

    <p>
        Repository maintainer decides what goes into 
        his (her) repository.
        And, when (if) to release it.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            The term <em>maintainer</em> is often used to refer to
            the position of project leader.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Although it may seem minor, this is the key point, 
        the primary difference between Linus' model and 
        every other way of developing software:
        Changes are submitted <em>by individuals to projects,</em> 
        inspected on a case-by-case basis, 
        and then either accepted into the project or rejected.
        Project leaders take on the responsibility of their work's 
        overall well-being, and can modify the code however they see
        fit; 
        they foster its development by
        considering proposed modifications.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, while users are in theory
        empowered to shape a project into what they want, 
        in practice these modifications are moderated by the project's
        maintainers.
        In this way, entities within the open-source ecosystem
        retain definition, and the community does not
        devolve into an equal-merit free-for-all.
    </p>

    <p>
        Given significant difference of opinion, an individual or group
        can always fork the source repository and 
        lead a sister project in their preferred direction.
        For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection#EGCS_fork">Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System</a> was a fork
        of GNU's compiler collection that included new languages 
        in a manner more free-wheeling than the FSF 
        found acceptable.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a nontrivial sense, the ability to choose and curate
        is the backbone of open-source, and takes place on
        multiple levels. 
        A distribution implicitly curates
        projects in their presentation of an operating system, while
        users curate distributions, projects and source, 
        however they see fit.

<div class="content" id="collaboration">
    <h2>Collaboration</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Recall that <em>open source</em> is a synonym for
            <em>free software.</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Properly speaking, open-source describes only how
        software is distributed and used&mdash; Not how
        it is produced.<sup><a href="#references" title="Eghbal p44">[a]</a></sup>
        Notably, it requires human-readable "source" be made available 
        alongside machine-readable instructions, and 
        that software be redistributable by any user.
    </p>

    <p>
        In particular, it does not restrict
        the organizational structure adopted to produce
        these works, and many open-source projects are <em>not</em> 
        open to collaboration.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, GNU is not collaborative:
        While users are permitted to
        modify and redistribute the project's works, those modifications 
        were never intended to make their way back into GNU source.
        Hence, there is a deliberate delineation between <em>user</em> and 
        <em>developer.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>Collaborative Open Source</h3>
    
    <p>
        When Linus Torvalds invited any interested hacker to
        tinker on his kernel, he invented a new
        way of making free software.
        The result was "Accidentally Revolutionary," and has
        dominated open-source since.
    </p>

    <p>
        It should be noted that there is no "rule" that collaboration
        is restricted to hobbyists, and being inclusive with
        respect to organizations fosters project success.
        Facebook, for example, has put considerable effort
        into Linux's new <code><a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">btrfs</a></code>.<sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/824855/">[h]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Collaborative open-source blurs the line between "user"
        and "developer": You can get as involved as you want.
        The advantages of this organizational structure are that
        developers are distributed, organizational costs are
        minimized, and individuals or groups
        may contribute to a project according to their own 
        desires.
    </p>

    <p>
        In practice, most modifications (~80%) are made by a small
        group of people. 
        More, most collaborators are "casual," offering one or 
        two commits to a project over its life.
        Finally, the vast majority of users are not collaborators at
        all; it is not the case that open-source is 
        powered by a collection of average users.

<div class="content" id="intrinsic-motivation">
    <h2>Intrinsic Motivation</h2>
    // The result is chaotic, in much the same way the free
    // market is chaotic.
    // The difference is currency.

    <p>
        Compared to the market economy we all know and love, 
        open source a strange beast:
        Its works are carried out because what they 
        are <em>is</em> what their creators want.
        A reasonable question to ask, is, <em>Why?</em>
        as in, <em>Why take seriously and labor for something
        without obvious monetary reward?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Economist Steven Weber offers some insight:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "Human beings often have a passionate relationship to their
        creative endeavors and their work; they wish to share
        their creativity with others; and value inheres in
        things other than monetizable rewards.  Each of these
        attitudes exists within the open source community."<sup><a href="#references" title="Weber p10">[g]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Collaborative open-source is not necessarily altruistic.
        While the motivations of an individual are, naturally, their own,
        and may well be strictly charitable, 
        those projects that are most enduring satisfy some community need, 
        and are supported in virtue of themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an example, the <em>util-linux</em> package was originally
        forked from the BSD project, and passed through
        several maintainers between versions 2.2 and 2.12.<sup><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git/refs/tags">[g]</a></sup>
        When it was clear that the project had been abandoned, it was
        <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/18/19">picked up again</a>
        by Karel Zak, whom continues to maintain it today.
        In this way, those projects which are of interest to the community
        are maintained, while those that are not are eventually dropped.

    // It is not the case that GNU has created the de-facto
    // open-source operating system.
    // What has proved to work has 
    // *decomposed* into a puzzle of some roughly 500 pieces.

    <p>
        The open-source ecosystem has decomposed into
        projects, with people working on what they want.
        While we may wish to think that each project is a paradigm
        of virtue and cooperation, this is in fact not the case.
        Public desire is often not homogenous, and the role of project leader 
        can quickly skew from 
        <em>lead developer</em> to <em>modification curator.</em>

    <h4>A Success Story</h4>

    <p>
        A <em>paging utility</em> is a program that displays a file on 
        the terminal one screenful at a time.
        The first widely used paging utility was <code>more</code>, written by
        Dan Halbert as a graduate student at UC Berkley in 1978.<sup><a href="https://danhalbert.org/more.html">[aa]</a></sup>
        <code>more</code> is a simple program: It first 
        fills up the screen, then waits for user input to print the 
        next line(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1983, Mark Nudelman was a software developer working for a
        company called Integrated Office Systems. From the <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#history"><code>less</code> FAQ</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Some of our software ran on a Unix system and produced enormous log files
        of its transactions. We wanted to be able to search these log files for
        error messages. But the version of "vi" we were using couldn't handle
        files larger than a certain size, and our log files often exceeded that
        size. So we were forced to use "more" to view the files. The problem was,
        once we found an error message, what we really wanted to see was the
        transactions leading up to the error; that is, the lines in the log file
        immediately before the error message. But more didn't allow backward
        movement in the file.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        We often complained about this problem. We said we needed a "backwards
        more"; someone (it wasn't me, but unfortunately I don't remember who
        it was) coined the name "less" as a joke on the concept of a "backwards
        more". It didn't seem to me that it would be too difficult to write a
        simple pager that would allow forward and backward movement.
        I wrote the first version in late 1983 and we began using it internally.
        I continued to enhance it and finally decided it was a useful enough
        tool that I should make it available to the world. I posted the first
        version to the newsgroup called (at that time) net.sources in May, 1985.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Making the program publicly available allowed an enormous number of
        people to use it. Many people have made their own modifications and
        donated them to me for incorporation into the official version, and
        many more have reported bugs they've found or made suggestions about
        features they'd like to see added. This was my first experience with
        the concept of what is now called "open source" or "free software",
        and it has, I believe, produced a very high quality product. I'd like
        to thank all the users of less for their invaluable comments and
        suggestions over the years. 
        Less wouldn't be what it is today without you.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Mark Nudelman continues to maintain the project today.  
        It is, at the time of this writing, in its 581<sup>st</sup> 
        version.<sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#version">[q]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/index.html">[r]</a></sup>

    <h2>Closing Remarks:</h2>
    <h4>Beware Hyperbole</h4>

    <p>
        Most people can make a program work&mdash; and programming is 
        a great hobby and a useful skill&mdash;
        but software that is widely used is extremely sophisticated.
        These projects are shepherded by talented and educated
        individuals, whom are professionals of their field.

        "Getting hooked on computers is easy—almost anybody can make a 
        program work, just as almost anybody can nail two pieces of wood 
        together in a few tries. The trouble is that the market for two 
        pieces of wood nailed together—inexpertly—is fairly small outside 
        of the "proud grandfather" segment, and getting from there to a 
        decent set of chairs or fitted cupboards takes talent, practice,
