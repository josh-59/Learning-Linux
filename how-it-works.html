title: How Open Source Works
last-updated: May 2021

<!--
Although I'd love to believe that open-source software
        is as casual as it's portrayed to be, it simply isn't.
        Good software is not easy to produce, and open-source is
        no different.
    </p>

    <p>
        Given intrinsic motivation, the open-source scene naturally
        decomposes into projects, with people working on what they want.
        This can give the appearance of self-satisfying development:
        For example, producing an operating system
        is outside the scope of the Linux kernel project.
        Nonetheless, these projects have formed something substantial.
    </p>


    <p>
        For example, Facebook has put extensive effort into
        Linux's new <code>btrfs</code>, commonly described as 
        "a modern copy-on-write filesystem."
        The filesystem eases routine administrative tasks, especially in 
        enterprise-class settings.
        Facebook has contributed to the project for their own purposes;
        nonetheless, the resulting software is GNU GPL'd 
        (Version 2, to be specific), 
        and so from the user's standpoint, is as free (libre) as anything
        crafted by GNU's own hand.
    </p>



    <p>
        "No one "owns" the software in the traditional sense of 
        being able to command how it is used or developed,
        or to control its disposition."
            http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.PDF
        "[Common's] central characteristic is that groups of individuals
        successfully collaborate on large-scale projects following a
        diverse cluster of motivational drives and social signals,
        rath than either market prices or managerial commands."
    </p>

    
    "Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
    Write programs that work together."

    Notes:
        The term <em>open source</em> describes the way that software
        is distributed and used, not to how it is produced.

        Reasons to participate in the "Commons"
        - Intrinsic Motivation
            - i.e., it's neat
        - Modular and Granular Tasks
        - Low Coordination Costs

    <h1>How Open Source Works</h1>

    <div class="quote-text">
        "That's how open source works: <br>Iterate, deploy, study, repeat."
    </div>

    <div class="quote-ref">

    </div>

    <p>
        So what makes it all tick?
        In this dramatic conclusion, we'll pick apart the
        key components of the open-source ecosystem,
        from the motivations of contributors to the leadership
        style necessarily implied by them.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="from-the-top">
    <h2>From the Top</h2>

    <p>
        <em>Open source</em> describes only how software is 
        distributed and used&mdash; Not how it is produced.<sup><a href="#references" title="Eghbal p44">[a]</a></sup>
        There isn't a great deal of money to be made in open source,
        and without the clear external motivation of money, open-source
        has been described as <em>intrinsically motivated.</em> 
    </p>

    <p>
        Whereas businesses start out pursuing money,
        open-source works characteristically begin by 
        satisfying some developer's itch.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus, the open-source scene naturally
        decomposes into projects, with people working on what they want;
        the result is simple self-satisfying development.
        For example, producing an operating system
        is outside the scope of the Linux kernel project:
        They do kernels for kernels' sake, and somebody interested
        in composing operating systems does that.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Fun Fact:</h4>
        <p>
            Linus Torvalds once turned down a job offer from Steve Jobs
            because it wasn't interesting from a technical 
            standpoint.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        That these projects have formed something substantial
        has called into question Coase's economic theory of the firm.
        By focusing only on the work, all other factors 
        may be ignored.
        Since money is the not issue, we don't have to worry about selling
        it;
        since nobody is being paid, personal qualifications may 
        be ignored;
        since 
    </p>
</div>


<div class="content" id="dividing">
    <h2>Dividing Open Source</h2>

    <p>
        Code is to an open-source project what money is to business: 
        The only thing that open-source projects necessarily
        have in common is that they each yield appropriately-licensed
        software, in much the same way that all business exist
        for the purpose of making money.
        Like businesses, open-source projects often follow
        a few models.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            The cathedral is characterized by a closed group of 
            developers publishing free software; it
            still has a place in modern open-source.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The most common open-source model today is what Eric S. 
        Raymond called the <em>Bazaar:</em> Contributions are welcome.
        This he juxtaposed against the then-traditional <em>Cathedral,</em>
        which is closed from public modifications.  
        Since its introduction, the bazaar model 
        has dominated open source.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nadia Eghbal, in her book <em>Working in Public,</em>
        further divides Bazaars into four:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p> 
                <b>Federation:</b> 
                Many users, many contributors; usually subdivided.  
                Examples: Linux kernel, Firefox, Debian
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Stadium:</b> 
                Many users, few contributors. 
                Examples: Bash, Linux Mint
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Club:</b> 
                Few users, most of whom are contributors. 
                Example: Slackware
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> 
                <b>Toy:</b> 
                Few users, few contributors. 
                Most projects start out as 'toys'
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Inviting people to contribute promotes project growth, 
        and projects have been known to move at shocking speed.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Given <em>too many</em> contributions, your primary goal is
        to filter them to something manageable.
        "These developers aren't building communities; they're 
        directing air 
        traffic."<sup><a href="#references" title="Eghbal p13">[a]</a></sup>

    <h4>Maintainership</h4>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Greg Kroah-Hartman once said, "Half my job is to say 'no'."
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Most proposed modifications are rejected.
        In fact, the role of maintainer quickly skews from developer
        to reviewer and curator.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Github is a propietary, for-profit business that describes itself
        as a "social coding platform." 
        It is characteristically two-dimensional, offering convenience
        at the expense of structure, and is appropriate for small
        projects (toys and clubs).
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course, a community is not out of the question;
    </p>

    <p>
        A <em>maintainer</em> is a person responsible for the future of the
        project.
        A <em>contributor</em> is a person who makes a modification to it,
        ranging from casual to significant.

    <h2>Incremental Improvement</h2>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
        Large projects, such as the Linux kernel or Mozilla Firefox,
        for whom many people might want to see a particular change,
        often preemptively schedule releases.  
        The intent is to produce a reiterative cycle 
        that accomodate both feature introduction <em>and</em> 
        commit rejection&mdash; if your change doesn't make it into 
        the latest kernel release, for instance, you only have to 
        wait six weeks for the next one.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the challenges of open-source project 
        leadership is delivering, as Mozilla calls it,
        "stability without stagnation."<sup><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html">[6]</a></sup>
        On one hand, we want to incorporate changes made by 
        many unknown people; but on the other,
        we also want to deliver a consistent product.
    </p>

    <p>
        One solution is to release a sequence of versions of the product:
        Even if each release is only
        marginally better than the previous, those improvements accrue,
        and the result is guaranteed to be great software.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Outside of the Linux kernel, Firefox is one of the largest and
            most aggressive open-source projects is 
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        For example, the last opportunity to merge feature
        changes in Firefox is before it enters <em>beta</em>.
        In beta, merges are restricted to bug fixes and 
        security updates. 
        Each release spends four weeks in <em>beta</em>
        before being released as the current official Firefox version.
    </p>

    <p>
        While it is released to the public, merges 
        are again restricted to bug fixes and
        security updates, and, again, each release
        is supported for four weeks:

    <p>
        Witin Mozilla, this is known as a "train schedule,"
        and we see that <em>Firefox 80</em> will be released as 
        <em>Firefox 81</em>
        enters Beta and <em>Firefox 82</em> enters Nightly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Firefox is one of the largest and most agressive open-source
        projects outside of the Linux kernel.
        It even spawned the (awesome) programming language, Rust.

    <h4>A Success Story</h4>

    <p>
        A <em>paging utility</em> is a program that displays a file on 
        the terminal one screenful at a time.
        The first widely used paging utility was <code>more</code>, written by
        Dan Halbert as a graduate student at UC Berkley in 1978.<sup><a href="https://danhalbert.org/more.html">[aa]</a></sup>
        <code>more</code> is a simple program, first filling up the screen,
        then waiting for user input to print the next line(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1983, Mark Nudelman was a software developer working for a
        company called Integrated Office Systems. From the <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#history"><code>less</code> FAQ</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Some of our software ran on a Unix system and produced enormous log files
        of its transactions. We wanted to be able to search these log files for
        error messages. But the version of "vi" we were using couldn't handle
        files larger than a certain size, and our log files often exceeded that
        size. So we were forced to use "more" to view the files. The problem was,
        once we found an error message, what we really wanted to see was the
        transactions leading up to the error; that is, the lines in the log file
        immediately before the error message. But more didn't allow backward
        movement in the file.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        We often complained about this problem. We said we needed a "backwards
        more"; someone (it wasn't me, but unfortunately I don't remember who
        it was) coined the name "less" as a joke on the concept of a "backwards
        more". It didn't seem to me that it would be too difficult to write a
        simple pager that would allow forward and backward movement.
        I wrote the first version in late 1983 and we began using it internally.
        I continued to enhance it and finally decided it was a useful enough
        tool that I should make it available to the world. I posted the first
        version to the newsgroup called (at that time) net.sources in May, 1985.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Making the program publicly available allowed an enormous number of
        people to use it. Many people have made their own modifications and
        donated them to me for incorporation into the official version, and
        many more have reported bugs they've found or made suggestions about
        features they'd like to see added. This was my first experience with
        the concept of what is now called "open source" or "free software",
        and it has, I believe, produced a very high quality product. I'd like
        to thank all the users of less for their invaluable comments and
        suggestions over the years. 
        Less wouldn't be what it is today without you.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Mark Nudelman continues to maintain the project today.  
        It is, at the time of this writing, in its 581<sup>st</sup> 
        version.<sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#version">[q]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/index.html">[r]</a></sup>

    <h4>An Analogy</h4>
       
    <p>
        To call open-source a hobby isn't quite strong enough; 
        at the same time, it isn't <em>work</em> in the 
        traditional sense, either.  
        Open-Source and GNU/Linux lie somewhere between the two,
        closer to sport.
        For me, the magic is that it's composed of
        things people created because they wanted to.
    </p>

    <p>
        While I'd love to believe that open-source is as casual
        as it's portrayed to be, it's simply not.
        Good software is not easy to produce: 
        It's one thing to write a Python script for your own 
        purposes (or even a shell to demonstrate the idea); it's
        quite another to produce a product that's useable by 
        millions of people.
    </p>

    <p>
        The reason I wrote this was because I spent a great deal
        of time failing to learn the material owing to
        misguided sources:  
        I didn't know where to look for relevant information, and often
        didn't know what to ask, to boot. 
        The reason I persisted with it was because, as it
        turns out, I'm better at writing than programming.  
    </p>

    <p>
        The ordinary user is not obligated to contribute.
        As Richard Stallman pointed out, software is not 
        like other tangible goods because software is very cheap
        to copy, and doing so does not degrade the original.
        The upshot is, you can be a lurker and <em>No one will know!</em>
        By far, the best thing a normal user can do 
        is create and pass detailed bug reports, when you find them.
    </p>

    <p>
        The core motivation behind these works is not ideological,
        but rather simple:
        They create things because it satisfies some desire of their own.
        I do not believe that engineers would, left to their own devices,
        build a pickup-truck that destroys the planet.
