    Bazaar Development Model
    <p>
         Whether this development model is best or not is a
         <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2349257">subject of
         debate</a>, but there can be no doubt that it has been successful:
         GNU/Linux is the most-used Unix-like
         operating system in existence today.
         I view these pieces as "competing", expect the best of
         them to rise in popularity, and let someone else worry about
         fitting them all together.

    <blockquote>
    "Thompson wanted to create a comfortable computing environment constructed 
    according to his own design, using whatever means were available. His plans, it 
    is evident in retrospect, incorporated many of the innovative aspects of Multics, 
    including an explicit notion of a process as a locus of control, a tree-structured 
    file system, a command interpreter as user-level program, simple representation 
    of text files, and generalized access to devices. They excluded others, such as 
    unified access to memory and to 
    files."<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html">[o]</a></sup>

    <h4>And why businesses rule the earth</h4>

    <p>
        Organization is about having a clear end-state, a well-defined goal.
        For example:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>"Most UNIX-like GNU/Linux distribution out there"</li>
        <li>"Most secure UNIX-like operating system"</li>
        <li>"A distribution by the people, for the people"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        At the risk of being too philosophical,
        "success" itself is defined only relative to a goal;
        every project must be well-organized, or it cannot be successful.

    <h2>The Bazaar Development Model</h2>

    <p>
        <strike>A collection of open-source projects is
        called a <em>bazaar.</em></strike>
        The term <em>bazaar</em> was first used by Eric S. Raymond
        to describe the Linux development model&mdash; "release early and often,
        be open to the point of promiscuity, delegate everything in sight"&mdash;
        which he contrasted with the traditional, "cathedral"-style development model.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a cathedral, software is openly available,
        sure, but is developed strictly in-house; the above
        remarks on forking and merging effectively don't apply.
        Contributions are restricted to a small cadre,
        who charge themselves with both the architecture and the
        implementation of an idea.
        The cathedral has its proponents (GNU, all BSD's).
        They argue that the traditional model affords greater opportunity for
        design, conception, and craftsmanship, and that these are
        critical considerations given their projects' goals.
    </p>

    <p>
        The bazaar model, by contast, welcomes strangers to contribute
        to the project, and more, to take responsibility within it.

    <h2>Fork/Merge</h2>

    <p>
        Recall that a repository is tracked collection of files,
        usually containing a package.
        Open-source repositories are made publicly available, and anyone
        may download or otherwise copy them.
        Such a copy is called a <em>fork.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Having created a fork, the software is now *yours*.
        You can inspect it, modify it, build it, install it, run it,
        discard it&mdash; whatever you want.
        If you change some of its files, though, we say that your fork and its source
        have <em>diverged.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Merging changes with the original is a process, and naturally
        involves the source repository's maintainer.
        The process begins with a <em>pull request,</em>
        which initiates a discussion about
        the proposed changes.<sup><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">[a]</a></sup>
        If accepted, the changes are made to the original,
        and the two repositories are identical again.
    </p>

    <p>
        This pattern repeats at various scales.
        Today's revision control software allows an individual programmer
        to create distinct branches within a local repository,
        and to merge or abandon changes as they fit.
        At the macro scale, this pattern repeated with GNU's compiler
        collection, when a collection of forks became a concurrent project, and was subsequently merged
        into GNU's main trunk.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection#EGCS_fork">[b]</a></sup>

    <h4>and Train Schedules </h4>

    <p>
        Software development is fundamentally reiterative:
        You build something, publish it, improve it and release it again.
        Such reiterative improvement is realized in both open- and closed-source
        development models.
    </p>

    <p>
        The "train schedule" formalizes this by putting it on
        a timetable;
        it is often adopted by larger projects as a means
        of organizing many (individually minor) changes into a coherent whole.

                Firefox is one of the largest and most agressive open-source
                projects outside of the Linux kernel.
                It even spawned the (awesome) programming language, Rust.
            </p>
        </div>


    <p>
        That is, each version spends four weeks in the <em>Mature</em> category,
        being the officially-supported, current version of Firefox.
        When here, no new features are implemented&mdash; rather, only
        security patches and bug-fixes are implemented and pushed to the user.
        After its four weeks in the spotlight, it is discarded,
        for the next version is ready.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before it becomes mature, each version of Firefox has been released as a <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/80.0beta/releasenotes/">beta</a>;
        this status corresponds to <em>Initial Release</em> above.
        When a release enters the <em>Beta</em> stage, only patches aimed at improving
        stability are accepted.<sup><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Release_Process">[6]</a></sup>
        Each release spends four weeks there.
        Finally, there is the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/80.0a1/releasenotes/">Nightly</a> build,
        which contains the latest (and most untested) features.
    </p>

<div class="content" id="modularity">
    <h2 style='margin-bottom: 0px;'>Modularity</h2>
    <h4>and The Unix Philosophy</h4>

    <p>
        GNU/Linux can be likened to a 1000-piece puzzle with 5000 available pieces:
        For any piece of the puzzle (shell, desktop environment,
        web browser, text editor&mdash; right down to 
        C libraries<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library#Implementations">[h]</a></sup>
        and kernels<sup><a href="https://www.kernel.org/">[i]</a></sup>), 
        there 
        are around five competent options to choose from.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is an example of modular construction, and it is often left to 
        the user to decide which software component 
        <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/instantiate">instantiates</a>
        each needed piece.
        Modular (as opposed to <em>monolithic</em>) construction lies at the
        heart of both open source and the UNIX philosophy:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "A serious attempt is made to apply the principle of modularity to everything on a Unix-like system, not only programs but also parts of programs, such as algorithms, and even the kernel. Thus, a Unix-like operating system generally (or at least ideally) consists of a small kernel together with a large number of small, specialized programs that can interact with each other through a variety of well-defined interfaces."<sup><a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html">[g]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            If the first statement of this section is taken literally, there are
            5<sup>1000</sup> possible GNU/Linux systems.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Modularity is realized in a variety of ways, and its implications
        are similarly numerous.
        Not only is the user presented with an abundance of choice,
        a programmer working on any given piece must solve a
        greatly simplified problem. 
        Consequently, numerous solutions may be tried, which then compete 
        amongst themselves.
        Most importantly, however, comprehension of a given piece is made possible,
        while comprehension of the whole is made unnecessary.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through modularity, a complex problem can, and has, been broken down
        and solved.
        The strategy has proved crucial not only to the development of computer
        software, but also 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture">computer hardware</a>, infrastructure and indeed,
        to mass production itself.<sup><a href="http://www.linfo.org/module.html">[j]</a></sup>
