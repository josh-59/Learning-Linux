    <p>
        Given significant difference of opinion, individuals and
        groups are always free to fork the source repository and lead
        a sister project in their preferred direction;
        thereafter, people can choose either the original or your
        variant.
        In practice, modifications are submitted, reviewed on a 
        case-by-case basis, and then either accepted or rejected;
        in a few weeks, a new version of the software is released.
    </p>

    <p>
        While collaboration is often believed to be the purview
        of hobbyists alone, as Greg Kroah-Hartman notes, 
        there are compelling reasons to return <em>any</em> improvement
        to its source.
        First, your improvement will be maintained along with all
        other improvements.
        Second, you no longer have to deal with two variants of the
        work, and will not have to merge your changes into the latest
        release.
        Third, the distributive production process is well-known
        for outpacing any individual or group effort, so that if
        you <em>don't,</em> your variant will be

        The classic free-software business model is to 
        offer services and support of free software.

        <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en">Red Hat</a>
        are two modern examples.
        While being slightly less true to the noble/hobby roots of
        GNU/Linux, the result is a well-structured collection of 
        software presented in a professional manner, and
        appeals to businesses and other commercial enterprises.

        made especially notable because software is not easy to produce!

    <p>
        Since each user can redistribute free software, earning money
        from it is typically less direct than simply selling it.
        In the above example, Facebook has the same relationship with
        <code>btrfs</code> as UPS has with its fleet of trucks: 
        They profit from its use, and do not sell the work directly.

    <p>
        Computer programming is not easy because what you're trying
        to do is not simple, and 
        the closed development style is often preferred by individuals
        with strong ideas of what quality code is.

    <blockquote>
        "Getting hooked on computers is easy—almost anybody can make a 
        program work, just as almost anybody can nail two pieces of wood 
        together in a few tries. The trouble is that the market for two 
        pieces of wood nailed together—inexpertly—is fairly small outside 
        of the "proud grandfather" segment, and getting from there to a 
        decent set of chairs or fitted cupboards takes talent, practice, 
        and education."<sup><a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2349257">[123]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>


        For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection#EGCS_fork">Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System</a> was a fork
        of GNU's compiler collection that included new languages 
        in a manner more free-wheeling than the FSF 
        found acceptable.

        Derivate works are common, as well:

        is a derivate of Mozilla Firefox focused on privacy, security and
        freedom.

    <p>
        To me, the magic of open-source is that it's composed of works
        people created because they wanted to.
        Nobody is collecting your data; nobody is getting rich;
        it's just good things made for their own sake.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most people can make a program work&mdash; and programming is 
        a great hobby and a useful skill&mdash;
        but software that is widely used is extremely sophisticated.
        The works we use every day are shepherded by talented and educated
        individuals, whom are professionals of their field.

    <h2>Project Leadership</h2>
    <p>
        Per tradition, collaboration is clearly invited by project leaders.
        If a work is collaborative, then there is probably 
        some documentation containing instructions for doing so.  
        For example, <code>fd</code>'s
        <code><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a></code>
        file.
    </p>

    <p>
        ...neither qualification nor merit...
        <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">Contributors' Covenant</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Even following the rules, collaborative projects are not the 
        paradigms of virtue and cooperation as we might expect them to be. 
        Notably, public desire is not uniform, and 
        the role of project leader can quickly skew from 
        <em>lead developer</em> to <em>modification curator.</em>
        This is especially true of large projects with widespread
        interest.

            Given significant difference of opinion, an individual or group

        </p>

    <p>
        Simply put, project maintainers are endowed to reject a 
        modification for any reason whatsoever.

    "They're directing air traffic."

    <p>
        The ability to choose and curate 
        successful open-source, and takes place on
        multiple levels. 
        Project leaders choose among proposed modification;
        distributions implicitly curate projects in their 
        (preferential) presentation of an operating system; and,
        users choose among distributions, projects and source, 
        however they see fit.

        So what makes it all tick?
        In this dramatic conclusion, we'll pick apart the
        key components of the open-source ecosystem,
        from the motivations of contributors to the leadership
        style necessarily implied by them.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="low-copy-cost">
    <h2>Low Copy Cost</h2>

    <p>
        In order to portray the success of open-source with any degree
        of honesty, we must first admit that it is dependant upon the
        low (virtually zero) cost of reproducing a piece of software.
    </p>

    <p>
        
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="intrinsic-motivation">
    <h2>Intrinsic Motivation</h2>

    <p>
        Compared to the market economy we all know and love, 
        open source a strange beast:
        Its works are created because what they 
        are <em>is</em> what their creators want.
        Stated another way, the intent of all free software is 
        the software itself.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>
            Here we are adopting a (very) high-level perspective of the
            open-source ecosystem.  
            By analogy, money, rather than passion, enjoyment, idealism, etc., 
            motivates work in the market economy.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Admittedly, contributing to open source sometimes makes 
        sound financial sense&mdash; Facebook 
        taking part in the development of 
        <code><a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">btrfs</a></code> 
        is one such example.
        However, in this case, as in all other cases, 
        the principal interest of Facebook is in the filesystem itself:
        It is developed to be used, not to be sold.
    </p>

    <p>
        Goods produced for their own sake are said
        to be <em>intrinsically motivated,</em> and this, in turn, 
        underpins the open-source ecosystem.
        Intrinsic motivation is found in many places, from research
        in academia to artistic works on public display.
    </p>

    <p>
        The open-source ecosystem has naturally decomposed into
        projects, with people working on what they want.
        While we may like to <em>think</em> that open-source is
        strictly the work of hobbyists, in practice this isn't the case.
        Since the resulting software may be used for any purpose&mdash;
        including commercial purposes&mdash; it has naturally come
        to pass that some developers intend to profit
        from its use.
    </p>

    <p>
        From the above, it would follow that those projects with
        the greatest number of use-cases garner the greatest support,
        and this I hold to be true:
        To date, the largest free-software organization in existence 
        is the 
        <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache Foundation</a>, 
        whose projects underpin the world wide web.

    <h2>Distributed Collaboration</h2>

    <p>
        The term <em>open-source</em> describes how software is 
        distributed and used&mdash; Not how it is produced.<sup><a href="#references" title="Eghba p44">[a]</a></sup>
        While it requires that source code be available to 
        users for perusal, modification and redistribution,
        it does not require that the project itself be collaborative, and
        many open-source projects are <em>not</em> open to collaboration.
    </p>

    <p>
        While collaboration is neither part of the 
        <em>open-source</em> definition nor part of the original
        intent of <em>free software,</em>
        it is both the novel component of today's open-source ecosystem 
        and, in the author's opinion, has been pivotal to its success.
        Therefore, we will pursue it here.
    <p>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            The "tools and materials" observation is owed to 
            Dr. Weber, as well.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        First, collaboration has been made possible:
        Anybody with an internet connection can download and use
        free software, and users are permitted to modify it to suit 
        their needs.
        Since the collection of free software includes all development 
        tools required to make modifications, both <em>tools</em> 
        and <em>materials</em> are made available.
    </p>

    <p>
        Second, collaboration is supported by project leaders.
        To make clear, a project's leader is the individual whom
        releases the official product.
        Notably, they alone can modify the code however they see fit.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since each leader has the right to modify their work
        however they see fit, they have the right to <em>decline</em>
        a modification for any reason whatsoever. 
        In practice, predominantly collaborative projects are led by 
        curating proposed modifications: The direction of the project
        is clearly stated, and the terms of acceptable modifications
        are made plain.
        It should be noted, however, that even in collaborative open-source,
        the majority of contributions come from a relatively small 
        pool of core developers; concurrently, most users do not submit 
        modifications.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Since collaboration is fun, you could take the view that
            it, also, is intrinsically motivated.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Finally, collaboration is just fun: There's a strong social
        component to it, a creative component to it, challenge and
        reward.
        Through "social coding" websites like Github and Gitlab,
        it has even been made convenient.
        Although programming itself is difficult, the act of 
        submitting a modification can be done by anyone, anywhere.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="content" id="modularity">
    <h2>Modularity</h2>

    <p>
        The final piece of the open-source ecosystem puzzle is
        <em>modularity&mdash;</em> specifically, the decomposition
        of a large and complex whole into manageable pieces.
        One of the truly remarkable things of modern open-source is that
        no one person or organization is responsible for the creation of 
        a GNU/Linux operating system.
        Rather, collecting and assembling the pieces is a project of its
        own, distinct from, say, shell development, itself distinct from,
        say, kernel development.
    </p>

    <p>
        This modularization occurred naturally as the free-software
        ecosystem became self-supporting, and it is, in the author's
        opinion, fundamental to the pattern of open-source success. 
        - Working on what they want
        - 
        Even large organizations tend to compartmentalize by project...
    </p>

    <p>
        <em><mark>
            The success of any project, with respect to producing a mature
            and polished product, is contingent principally 
            upon its improvement through long-term evolution.
        </mark></em>
        The modularity of GNU/Linux has allowed it to mature by
        allowing individual projects to come and go.
    </p>

    <p>
        Apache is the largest free- and open-source software organization in
        existence today, and to understand <em>how</em> to be as
        successful as GNU intended to be, it is necessary to understand
    </p>

    <p>
        Pleasing, at least, to the author's aesthetic, 
        the result is distinctively decentralized:
        There are few, if any, universal authorities, and 
        there are an astounding number of choices for any given user.

    <h4>A Success Story</h4>

    <p>
        A <em>paging utility</em> is a program that displays a file on 
        the terminal one screenful at a time.
        The first widely used paging utility was <code>more</code>, written by
        Dan Halbert as a graduate student at UC Berkeley in 1978.<sup><a href="https://danhalbert.org/more.html">[aa]</a></sup>
        <code>more</code> is a simple program: It first 
        fills up the screen, then waits for user input to print the 
        next line(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1983, Mark Nudelman was a software developer working for a
        company called Integrated Office Systems. From the <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#history"><code>less</code> FAQ</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Some of our software ran on a Unix system and produced enormous log files
        of its transactions. We wanted to be able to search these log files for
        error messages. But the version of "vi" we were using couldn't handle
        files larger than a certain size, and our log files often exceeded that
        size. So we were forced to use "more" to view the files. The problem was,
        once we found an error message, what we really wanted to see was the
        transactions leading up to the error; that is, the lines in the log file
        immediately before the error message. But more didn't allow backward
        movement in the file.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        We often complained about this problem. We said we needed a "backwards
        more"; someone (it wasn't me, but unfortunately I don't remember who
        it was) coined the name "less" as a joke on the concept of a "backwards
        more". It didn't seem to me that it would be too difficult to write a
        simple pager that would allow forward and backward movement.
        I wrote the first version in late 1983 and we began using it internally.
        I continued to enhance it and finally decided it was a useful enough
        tool that I should make it available to the world. I posted the first
        version to the newsgroup called (at that time) net.sources in May, 1985.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Making the program publicly available allowed an enormous number of
        people to use it. Many people have made their own modifications and
        donated them to me for incorporation into the official version, and
        many more have reported bugs they've found or made suggestions about
        features they'd like to see added. This was my first experience with
        the concept of what is now called "open source" or "free software",
        and it has, I believe, produced a very high quality product. I'd like
        to thank all the users of less for their invaluable comments and
        suggestions over the years. 
        Less wouldn't be what it is today without you.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        By and large, the health of a project can be determined by 
        how vigorously it is being developed:

        "Code by itself almost rots and it's gotta be rewritten.  Even when nothing has changed, for some reason it rots."<sup><a title="Interview with Ken Thompson, Coders at work, p. 460" href="#references">[e]</a></sup>

        made a few overarching mistakes. 1) Microarchitecture
        2) Repeat of GNU 
        - Did many things rather mediocrely(?)

        "The purpose of [a] model is not to represent reality;
        its purpose is to place in sharp relief particular elements
        of reality so we can look at the model from different angles,
        tweak it in various directions, generalize it, and then
        come back to reality with a deeper understanding of what
        happens there."<sup><a href="#references" title="Weber p 129">[a]</a></sup>
