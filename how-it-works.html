<!--

    The purpose of this article is to describe, in broad strokes,
    how the open-source ecosystem works. 

    <p>
        While collaboration is often believed to be the purview
        of hobbyists alone, as Greg Kroah-Hartman notes, 
        there are compelling reasons to return <em>any</em> improvement
        to its source.
        First, your improvement will be maintained along with all
        other improvements.
        Second, you no longer have to deal with two variants of the
        work, and will not have to merge your changes into the latest
        release.
        Third, the distributive production process is well-known
        for outpacing any individual or group effort, so that if
        you <em>don't,</em> your variant will be

            distribution, typically, the cost of media.

    <p>
        To me, the magic of open-source is that it's composed of works
        people created because they wanted to.
        The works we use every day are shepherded by talented and educated
        individuals, whom are professionals of their field.

    <p>
        Nobody is collecting your data; nobody is getting rich;
        it's just good things made for their own sake.

        The ability to choose and curate 
        successful open-source, and takes place on
        multiple levels. 
        Project leaders choose among proposed modification;
        distributions implicitly curate projects in their 
        (preferential) presentation of an operating system; and,
        users choose among distributions, projects and source, 
        however they see fit.

        So what makes it all tick?
        In this dramatic conclusion, we'll pick apart the
        key components of the open-source ecosystem,
        from the motivations of contributors to the leadership
        style necessarily implied by them.
        Note: This article focuses on collaborative open-source, 
        and ignores non-collaborative (e.g., "Cathedral")

    <h2>Non-Rival</h2>

    <p>
        Our first task is to describe the product being distributed.

    <p>
        Software is <em>non-rival:</em>
        This means that it can be used by many people as easily as it
        can be used by one.
        A good example of a non-rival good is a television broadcast:
        It may be watched by one or it may be watched by many
        without the broadcaster making any distinction.

        "The purpose of [a] model is not to represent reality;
        its purpose is to place in sharp relief particular elements
        of reality so we can look at the model from different angles,
        tweak it in various directions, generalize it, and then
        come back to reality with a deeper understanding of what
        happens there."<sup><a href="#references" title="Weber p 129">[a]</a></sup>

        <h4>Remember:</h4>
        <p>
            <em>We want what it is.</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Compared to the market economy we all know and love, 
        open source a strange beast:
        Its works are created because what they 
        are <em>is</em> what their creators want.
        Stated another way, the intent of all free software is 
        the software itself.
        Goods produced for their own sake are said
        to be <em>intrinsically motivated,</em> and 
        this underpins the open-source ecosystem.
        Intrinsic motivation is found in many other places, 
        such as academic research and artistic works set on 
        public display.
    </p>

    <p>
        Admittedly, we are adopting a very high-level perspective of the
        open-source ecosystem: 
        Many contributors to the free software ecosystem have other 
        motivations, such as passion, enjoyment, idealism, etc..
        Nonetheless, it is the author's opinion that intrinsic motivation 
        serves the same fundamental purpose to the open-source ecosystem 
        that money serves within the market economy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Contributing to open source sometimes makes 
        sound financial sense&mdash; Facebook 
        taking part in the development of 
        <code><a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">btrfs</a></code> 
        is one such example.
        However, in this case, as in most other cases, 
        the principal interest of Facebook is in the filesystem itself:
        It is developed to be used, not to be sold, and is therefore
        developed for its intrinsic value, rather than direct profit.
    </p>

    <p>
        If intrinsic motivation indeed serves as the principle motivation
        of open-source software, 
        then it would follow that those projects with
        the greatest number of use-cases garner the greatest support.
        To date, the largest free-software organization in existence 
        is neither GNU nor Linux, but the 
        <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache Foundation</a>, 
        whose projects underpin the world wide web.

    <p>
        The members of the open-source community work together in a
        highly parallel and nearly unstructured fashion.
        Weber lists this as the defining characteristic of the open-source
        process:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <em>The key element of the open source process, as an ideal type,
        is the voluntary participation and voluntary selection of
        tasks.</em>[sic]
        Anyone can join an open source project, and anyone can leave at
        any time.
        That is not just a free market in labor.  
        What makes it different from the theoretical option of exit
        from a corporate organization is this: Each person is free to
        choose what he wishes to work on or to contribute.
        There is no consciously organized or enforced division of labor.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Each person is presented with the same core code-base&mdash;
        the project as it exists presently&mdash;
        and can modify it however they desire.
        A project maintainer may suggest things that could use improvement,
        but no user is obliged to make those changes, and any user
        can make other modifications.
    </p>
</div>


<div class="content" id="modularity">
    <h2>Modularity</h2>

    <p>
        Since Richard Stallman began the GNU project, the open-source 
        ecosystem has grown, with people working on the things they want.
        While we may like to <em>think</em> that open-source is
        strictly the work of hobbyists, in practice this isn't the case.
        Since the resulting software may be used for any purpose&mdash;
        including commercial purposes&mdash; it has naturally come
        to pass that some developers intend to profit
        from its use.
    </p>

    <p>
        The result is totally decentralized:
        There are relatively few authorities over the open-source ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the truly remarkable things of modern open-source is that
        no one person or organization is responsible for the creation of 
        a GNU/Linux operating system.
        Rather, collecting and assembling the pieces is a project of its
        own, distinct from, say, shell development, itself distinct from,
        say, kernel development.

            An open-source software project without a maintainer 
            is said to be <em>unmaintained.</em> 
            It has been effectively abandoned 
            (and/or is looking for a maintainer :).
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Typically, though, a piece of free software will have one
        trusted maintainer. 
        This person is responsible for presenting the
        project to the world, and
        for releasing new versions as they become mature.
        Maintainers have the right to modify their work
        however they see fit, 
        can accept users' modifications however they see fit,
        and have the right to <em>decline</em>
        a modification for any reason whatsoever. 
        In practice, discussion usually precedes modification.
        After modifications are submitted, they are reviewed on a 
        case-by-case basis, and then either accepted or rejected.

            The success of any project, with respect to producing a mature

    <h4>A Success Story</h4>

    <p>
        A <em>paging utility</em> is a program that displays a file on 
        the terminal one screenful at a time.
        The first widely used paging utility was <code>more</code>, written by
        Dan Halbert as a graduate student at UC Berkeley in 1978.<sup><a href="https://danhalbert.org/more.html">[aa]</a></sup>
        <code>more</code> is a simple program: It first 
        fills up the screen, then waits for user input to print the 
        next line(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1983, Mark Nudelman was a software developer working for a
        company called Integrated Office Systems. From the <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#history"><code>less</code> FAQ</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Some of our software ran on a Unix system and produced enormous log files
        of its transactions. We wanted to be able to search these log files for
        error messages. But the version of "vi" we were using couldn't handle
        files larger than a certain size, and our log files often exceeded that
        size. So we were forced to use "more" to view the files. The problem was,
        once we found an error message, what we really wanted to see was the
        transactions leading up to the error; that is, the lines in the log file
        immediately before the error message. But more didn't allow backward
        movement in the file.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        We often complained about this problem. We said we needed a "backwards
        more"; someone (it wasn't me, but unfortunately I don't remember who
        it was) coined the name "less" as a joke on the concept of a "backwards
        more". It didn't seem to me that it would be too difficult to write a
        simple pager that would allow forward and backward movement.
        I wrote the first version in late 1983 and we began using it internally.
        I continued to enhance it and finally decided it was a useful enough
        tool that I should make it available to the world. I posted the first
        version to the newsgroup called (at that time) net.sources in May, 1985.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Making the program publicly available allowed an enormous number of
        people to use it. Many people have made their own modifications and
        donated them to me for incorporation into the official version, and
        many more have reported bugs they've found or made suggestions about
        features they'd like to see added. This was my first experience with
        the concept of what is now called "open source" or "free software",
        and it has, I believe, produced a very high quality product. I'd like
        to thank all the users of less for their invaluable comments and
        suggestions over the years. 
        Less wouldn't be what it is today without you.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Mark Nudelman continues to maintain the project today.  
        It is, at the time of this writing, in its 581<sup>st</sup> 
        version.<sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#version">[q]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/index.html">[r]</a></sup>

        In ____ the term <em>open-source</em> was chosen as a less-abrasive 
        sysnonym for Stallman's <em>free software.</em>
        While this new term served its purpose, it is still imperfect,
        as it connotes an ideal. 
        In a nontrivial sense, the notions of both open-source and
        free software are captured by, simply, <em>community.</em>
        For, it is the community that produced it, the community which
