    Notes:
        The term <em>open source</em> describes the way that software
        is distributed and used, not to how it is produced.
            p 44


        Reasons to participate in the "Commons"
        - Intrinsic Motivation
            - i.e., it's neat
        - Modularity and Granular Tasks
        - Low Coordination Costs
            Benkler, p74

        "Defining membership boundaries in an open source project turns out to
        be one of the hardest problems to solve."

        

        Open-source projects create

    "Modularity is extremely important to such a large collection of
    software as a distribution."
        -Ian Murdock,

    Quotes:
        "Don't be a dick."

        So what makes it all tick?
        In this dramatic conclusion, we'll pick apart the
        key components of the open-source ecosystem,
        from the mechanics of contributing, to the

        <em>Open source</em> describes only how software is 
        distributed and used&mdash; Not how it is produced.<sup><a href="#references" title="Eghbal p44">[a]</a></sup>
        As Nadia Eghbal points out, code is to open-source projects
        what money is to businesses, and there are many successful 
        open-source organizational models, in much the same way that
        there are many successful business models.
        For the user, the reasons that a particular 
        open-source project exists matters less than what it is.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, Facebook has put extensive effort into
        Linux's new <code>btrfs</code>, commonly described as 
        "a modern copy-on-write filesystem."
        It eases routine administrative tasks, especially in 
        enterprise-class settings;
        They have done so for their own purposes, rather than
        altruistic motives.
        Nonetheless, the resulting software is GNU GPL'd 
        (Version 2, to be specific), 
        and so from any user's standpoint, it is as free (libre) as anything
        crafted by GNU's own hand.

    <h2>Project Leadership</h2>

    <p>
        Large projects, such as the Linux kernel or Mozilla Firefox,
        for whom many people might want to see a particular change,
        often premetively schedule releases.  
        The intent is to produce a reiterative cycle 
        that accomodates both feature introduction <em>and</em> 
        commit rejection&mdash; if your change doesn't make it into 
        the latest kernel release, for instance, you only have to 
        wait six weeks for the next one.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the challenges of open-source project 
        leadership is delivering, as Mozilla calls it,
        "stability without stagnation."<sup><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html">[6]</a></sup>
        On one hand, we want to incorporate changes made by 
        many unknown people; but on the other,
        we also want to deliver a consistent product.
    </p>

    <p>
        One solution is to release a sequence of versions of the product:
        Even if each release is only
        marginally better than the previous, those improvements accrue,
        and the result is guaranteed to be great software.

        <p>
            Outside of the Linux kernel, Firefox is one of the largest and
            most agressive open-source projects is 
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        For example, the last opportunity to merge feature
        changes in Firefox is before it enters <em>beta</em>.
        In beta, merges are restricted to bug fixes and 
        security updates. 
        Each release spends four weeks in <em>beta</em>
        before being released as the current official Firefox version.
    </p>

    <p>
        While it is released to the public, merges 
        are again restricted to bug fixes and
        security updates, and, again, each release
        is supported for four weeks:

        <figcaption><center><b><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar">Firefox Release Schedule</a></b></center></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Witin Mozilla, this is known as a "train schedule,"
        and we see that <em>Firefox 80</em> will be released as 
        <em>Firefox 81</em>
        enters Beta and <em>Firefox 82</em> enters Nightly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Firefox is one of the largest and most agressive open-source
        projects outside of the Linux kernel.
        It even spawned the (awesome) programming language, Rust.

        In particular, strict adherents of the "cathedral" model

    <h4>A Success Story</h4>

    <p>
        A <em>paging utility</em> is a program that displays a file on 
        the terminal one screenful at a time.
        The first widely used paging utility was <code>more</code>, written by
        Dan Halbert as a graduate student at UC Berkley in 1978.<sup><a href="https://danhalbert.org/more.html">[aa]</a></sup>
        <code>more</code> is a simple program, first filling up the screen,
        then waiting for user input to print the next line(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1983, Mark Nudelman was a software developer working for a
        company called Integrated Office Systems. From the <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#history"><code>less</code> FAQ</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Some of our software ran on a Unix system and produced enormous log files
        of its transactions. We wanted to be able to search these log files for
        error messages. But the version of "vi" we were using couldn't handle
        files larger than a certain size, and our log files often exceeded that
        size. So we were forced to use "more" to view the files. The problem was,
        once we found an error message, what we really wanted to see was the
        transactions leading up to the error; that is, the lines in the log file
        immediately before the error message. But more didn't allow backward
        movement in the file.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        We often complained about this problem. We said we needed a "backwards
        more"; someone (it wasn't me, but unfortunately I don't remember who
        it was) coined the name "less" as a joke on the concept of a "backwards
        more". It didn't seem to me that it would be too difficult to write a
        simple pager that would allow forward and backward movement.
        I wrote the first version in late 1983 and we began using it internally.
        I continued to enhance it and finally decided it was a useful enough
        tool that I should make it available to the world. I posted the first
        version to the newsgroup called (at that time) net.sources in May, 1985.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Making the program publicly available allowed an enormous number of
        people to use it. Many people have made their own modifications and
        donated them to me for incorporation into the official version, and
        many more have reported bugs they've found or made suggestions about
        features they'd like to see added. This was my first experience with
        the concept of what is now called "open source" or "free software",
        and it has, I believe, produced a very high quality product. I'd like
        to thank all the users of less for their invaluable comments and
        suggestions over the years. 
        Less wouldn't be what it is today without you.
    </blockquote>

        Mark Nudelman continues to maintain the project today.  
        It is, at the time of this writing, in its 581<sup>st</sup>

    <h2 style='margin-bottom: 0px;'>Modularity</h2>
    <h4>and The Unix Philosophy</h4>

    <p>
        GNU/Linux can be likened to a 500-piece puzzle with 2500 available pieces:
        For any piece of the puzzle (shell, desktop environment,
        web browser, text editor&mdash; right down to
        C libraries<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library#Implementations">[h]</a></sup>
        and kernels<sup><a href="https://www.kernel.org/">[i]</a></sup>),
        there are around five competent options to choose from.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is an example of modular construction, and it is often
        left to the user to decide which software component
        instantiates each needed piece.
        Modular (as opposed to <em>monolithic</em>) construction lies at the
        heart of both open source and the UNIX philosophy:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "A serious attempt is made to apply the principle of modularity to everything on a Unix-like system, not only programs but also parts of programs, such as algorithms, and even the kernel. Thus, a Unix-like operating system generally (or at least ideally) consists of a small kernel together with a large number of small, specialized programs that can interact with each other through a variety of well-defined interfaces."<sup><a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html">[g]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Thanks to modular construction, the development of 
        GNU/Linux becomes cyclic.
        Consider:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Some developer identifies a deficiency in the current ecosystem
        </li>
        <li>
            This component is relatively small, 
        </li>
        <li>
            They may try their hand at solving it
        </li>
        <li>
            These solutions compete amongst themselves, with the
            more promising of them being developed further.
        </li>
        <li>
            Consequently, the user is presented with an abundance of choice,
            and the cycle continues.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Linus' Real Law </h3>

    <p>
        The importance of modularity to software development is difficult
        to overstate.
    </p>

    <h2>Incremental Improvement</h2>

    <p>
        To call open source a hobby isn't quite strong enough; 
        at the same time, it isn't necessarily "work," either.  
        Open-Source and GNU/Linux lie somewhere between the two,
        closer to sport.
        For me, the magic is that it's composed of
        things people created because they wanted to.
        As it turns out, they've built something stellar, and best
        of all, you can check it out for yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
        The underlying difference in software is that it is
        very cheap to copy, and as Richard Stallman points out,
        doing so does not degrade the original.
        It therefore exists as a <em>plan</em> of something, to 
        be realized at the user's discretion.
    </p>

    <h3>Where to from here?</h3>

    <p>
        I wrote this because I was interested in computers, and was
        continually astounded by the quality of open-source wares.
        Simply put, for those interested in computer science, there does
        not exist a better platform for research and development that
        GNU/Linux.
