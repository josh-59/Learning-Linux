    Notes:
        The term <em>open source</em> describes the way that software
        is distributed and used, not to how it is produced.

        Although I'd love to believe that open-source software
        is as casual as it's portrayed to be, it simply isn't.
        Good software is not easy to produce, and open-source is
        not different.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="from-the-top">
    <h2>From the Top</h2>

    <p>
        <em>Open source</em> describes only how software is 
        distributed and used&mdash; Not how it is produced.<sup><a href="#references" title="Eghbal p44">[a]</a></sup>
        As Nadia Eghbal points out, code is to open-source projects
        what money is to businesses: 
        The only thing that open-source projects necessarily
        have in common is that they each yield appropriately-licensed
        software, in much the same way that all business exist
        for the purpose of making money.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the user, the reasons behind a particular 
        open-source project don't matter.
        For example, Facebook has put extensive effort into
        Linux's new <code>btrfs</code>, commonly described as 
        "a modern copy-on-write filesystem."
        The software eases routine administrative tasks, especially in 
        enterprise-class settings.
        Facebook has contributed to the project for their own purposes;
        nonetheless, the resulting software is GNU GPL'd 
        (Version 2, to be specific), 
        and so from the user's standpoint, is as free (libre) as anything
        crafted by GNU's own hand.
    </p>

    <p>
        The difference between an open-source project and a free-market
        business has been the subject of formal research by a few
        economists.  
        For me, their discussion reduces to <em>motivation:</em> 
        Whereas businesses are motivated to produce for money 
        (in their words, "extrinsically motivated"), 
        open-source is "intrinsically motivated"&mdash; it's done for
        its own sake.
    </p>

    <p>
        "No one "owns" the software in the traditional sense of 
        being able to command how it is used or developed,
        or to control its disposition."
            http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.PDF
        "[Common's] central characteristic is that groups of individuals
        successfully collaborate on large-scale projects following a
        diverse cluster of motivational drives and social signals,
        rath than either market prices or managerial commands."

    <h2>Incremental Improvement</h2>

    <p>
        Large projects, such as the Linux kernel or Mozilla Firefox,
        for whom many people might want to see a particular change,
        often preemptively schedule releases.  
        The intent is to produce a reiterative cycle 
        that accomodate both feature introduction <em>and</em> 
        commit rejection&mdash; if your change doesn't make it into 
        the latest kernel release, for instance, you only have to 
        wait six weeks for the next one.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the challenges of open-source project 
        leadership is delivering, as Mozilla calls it,
        "stability without stagnation."<sup><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html">[6]</a></sup>
        On one hand, we want to incorporate changes made by 
        many unknown people; but on the other,
        we also want to deliver a consistent product.
    </p>

    <p>
        One solution is to release a sequence of versions of the product:
        Even if each release is only
        marginally better than the previous, those improvements accrue,
        and the result is guaranteed to be great software.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Outside of the Linux kernel, Firefox is one of the largest and
            most aggressive open-source projects is 
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        For example, the last opportunity to merge feature
        changes in Firefox is before it enters <em>beta</em>.
        In beta, merges are restricted to bug fixes and 
        security updates. 
        Each release spends four weeks in <em>beta</em>
        before being released as the current official Firefox version.
    </p>

    <p>
        While it is released to the public, merges 
        are again restricted to bug fixes and
        security updates, and, again, each release
        is supported for four weeks:

    </figure>

    <p>
        Witin Mozilla, this is known as a "train schedule,"
        and we see that <em>Firefox 80</em> will be released as 
        <em>Firefox 81</em>
        enters Beta and <em>Firefox 82</em> enters Nightly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Firefox is one of the largest and most agressive open-source
        projects outside of the Linux kernel.
        It even spawned the (awesome) programming language, Rust.

    <h4>A Success Story</h4>

    <p>
        A <em>paging utility</em> is a program that displays a file on 
        the terminal one screenful at a time.
        The first widely used paging utility was <code>more</code>, written by
        Dan Halbert as a graduate student at UC Berkley in 1978.<sup><a href="https://danhalbert.org/more.html">[aa]</a></sup>
        <code>more</code> is a simple program, first filling up the screen,
        then waiting for user input to print the next line(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1983, Mark Nudelman was a software developer working for a
        company called Integrated Office Systems. From the <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#history"><code>less</code> FAQ</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Some of our software ran on a Unix system and produced enormous log files
        of its transactions. We wanted to be able to search these log files for
        error messages. But the version of "vi" we were using couldn't handle
        files larger than a certain size, and our log files often exceeded that
        size. So we were forced to use "more" to view the files. The problem was,
        once we found an error message, what we really wanted to see was the
        transactions leading up to the error; that is, the lines in the log file
        immediately before the error message. But more didn't allow backward
        movement in the file.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        We often complained about this problem. We said we needed a "backwards
        more"; someone (it wasn't me, but unfortunately I don't remember who
        it was) coined the name "less" as a joke on the concept of a "backwards
        more". It didn't seem to me that it would be too difficult to write a
        simple pager that would allow forward and backward movement.
        I wrote the first version in late 1983 and we began using it internally.
        I continued to enhance it and finally decided it was a useful enough
        tool that I should make it available to the world. I posted the first
        version to the newsgroup called (at that time) net.sources in May, 1985.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Making the program publicly available allowed an enormous number of
        people to use it. Many people have made their own modifications and
        donated them to me for incorporation into the official version, and
        many more have reported bugs they've found or made suggestions about
        features they'd like to see added. This was my first experience with
        the concept of what is now called "open source" or "free software",
        and it has, I believe, produced a very high quality product. I'd like
        to thank all the users of less for their invaluable comments and
        suggestions over the years. 
        Less wouldn't be what it is today without you.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Mark Nudelman continues to maintain the project today.  
        It is, at the time of this writing, in its 581<sup>st</sup> 
        version.<sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#version">[q]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/index.html">[r]</a></sup>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Sports:</h2>
    <h4>An Analogy</h4>
        

    <p>
        To call open source a hobby isn't quite strong enough; 
        at the same time, it isn't <em>work</em> in the 
        traditional sense, either.  
        Open-Source and GNU/Linux lie somewhere between the two,
        closer to sport.
        For me, the magic is that it's composed of
        things people created because they wanted to.
    </p>

    <p>
        I do not believe that the ordinary user is 
        obligated to contribute to open source.
        In particular, projects strictly following the "cathedral" model 
        do not accept user modifications:
        Rather, they are interested in making what they want, 
        and have little interest in accepting modifications from outsiders.
    </p>

    <p>
        The underlying difference in software is that it is
        very cheap to copy, and as Richard Stallman points out,
        copying software does not degrade the original.
    </p>
