        <li>Elhage, N. (2009, December 22). A Brief Introduction to Termios. Retrieved March 07, 2021, from <a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/2009/12/a-brief-introduction-to-termios/">https://blog.nelhage.com/2009/12/a-brief-introduction-to-termios/</a></li>

To Do:
    Device files (or Mounting a filesystem):
        Device files are user-space references to the device
            (and not the principle reference to the device).
        They are useful 


    Somewhere:
        EOF, and CTRL+D

    Add reference to (in mounting and unmounting)
    Sudo/Superuser priveledges
</div>

sysfs:
    A view of the kernel, not intended for inspection by system's administrators.


Filesystem Heirarchy:
    /var:
        (Double check:) Per-runtime variable files
        https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch05.html:
            /var contains logs, transient and temporary files
            Not shareable across systems


XDG Directory Specification
    ~/.config is defined as part of the XDG specification

Another convention:
    Each program is typically allowed one file in important system directories
    (e.g., <code>/etc</code>)
    If they have a single file to store, it may be stored plainly; if they
    have more than one file to store, they should make a subdirectory and
    store them within.

    <p>
        The protogenesis of Unix was a filesystem.<sup><a href=#references>[1]</a><a href="http://read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[2]</a></sup>
        Designed by the researchers of Bell Laboratories and
        implemented primarily by Ken Thompson,
        this piece of software became an operating system 
        when a means of interacting with its contents was
        introduced.
        Being a Unix-like operating system, GNU/Linux
        inherits Unix's file semantics.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="files" class="content">
    <h2>Files</h2>

    <p>
        In Unix, a file is a sequence of bytes.<sup><a href=#references>[1]</a></sup>
        This definition is sufficiently abstract to allow, for instance, a keyboard
        to appear as a file.
        Unix-like kernels facilitate interaction with files via four essential
        system calls:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><em><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open()</a></em></li>
        <li><em><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html">close()</a></em></li>
        <li><em><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read()</a></em></li>
        <li><em><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write()</a></em></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        In particular, the <em>read()</em> system call fills a given
        buffer with the contents of a file;
        order is preserved across sequential calls to <em>read()</em>.
        When a program requests a read, the kernel suspends its execution,
        loads the appropriate data, then resumes execution of the program.
    </p>

    <h3>File Attributes</h3>

    <p>
        Unix-like operating systems characteristically store a substantial
        amount of information about each file on the system.
        This information, known as
        <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a>,</em>
        is stored alongside the file, typically on-disk.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Oddly, this information does not include the file's name.
            More on this below.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        File metadata consists of:
    </p>


    <ul>
        <li>File Type</li>
        <li>Read/Write/Execute Permissions</li>
        <li>Owner</li>
        <li>Group</li>
        <li>Size</li>
        <li>Timestamps</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This information is kept for every file on the machine,
        and can be explained in part by the operating system's multi-user heritage.
        It is used today to compartmentalize the machine.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="content" id="regular-files">
    <h2>Regular Files</h2>

    <p>
        A regular file is stored on disk or other persistent storage device.
        Most files are regular files.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here we have a typical <code>ls</code> listing:
    </p>

    <a href="assets/img/ls-long.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/ls-long.png" style="width: 100%" title="Click for PDF" ></a>

    <div class="aside-right" style="margin-top:25px;">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Access restrictions are enforced by the kernel.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The first character, a hyphen (<code>-</code>), tells us that
        <code>/bin/bash</code> names a regular file.
        The next nine characters are the file's
        <a href="http://linfo.org/permissions.html">permission bits</a>;
        the <code>r</code> and <code>x</code> present in each trio indicate
        that this file is readable and executable (respectively) by any user on
        the system.
        The <code>w</code> present only in the owner trio indicates that the
        file may be written to only by its owner, who in this case
        is <code>root</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Two other tools for peeking
        into a file are <code><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/file.1.html">file</a></code>, which attempts to categorize the file, and
        <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/stat.1.html">stat</a></code>, which prints the file's complete metadata:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ file /bin/bash<br>
        /bin/bash: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), <br>

    </div>

    <p>
        To simply view the contents of a file, we can use the <code>less</code>
        paging utility, which displays one screenful of the file at a time.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="device-files" class="content">
    <h2>Device Files</h2>

    <p>
        The Unix directory tree is used as a general-purpose 
        meeting place:
        In addition to regular files, it also contains references to
        hardware, and allows interprocess communication.
        This mechanism is general, extensible, and allows both users 
        and programmers access to the running machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <em>device file</em> represents a device connected to the system.
        They reside in <code>/dev</code>.<sup><a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch03s06.html">[3]</a></sup>
        Each file therein serves as a user-space handle to its
        respective device.
        For example, when a USB-stick is inserted,
        a new file appears in <code>/dev</code>, and it may be 
        read from or written to <em>directly</em> by passing
        this file to tools like <code>cat</code> or <code>dd</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that the essential capabilities of the USB-stick are 
        preserved through the <em>file</em> interface: It can be 
        written to and read from. 
        If we were to add the capacity to <em>seek</em> (i.e., change 
        location) within the file, then we would be able to use the 
        device in its entirety, through this interface alone.
    </p>

    <h3> Block and Character Device Files </h3>

    <p>
        Unix kernels support two kinds of device files:
        <em>Block</em> and <em>character.</em>
        A character device file may only be written to, or read from,
        a single byte (ASCII character) at a time.
        A terminal is one kind of device represented by a 
        character device file.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hard disks, SSD's and removable mass media are represented by
        <em>block</em> device files.
        Since the underlying devices support reading and writing 
        in blocks of bytes at a time, the kernel must take care
        to buffer arbitrary user-space interactions with it. 
        Additionally, block device files support seeking, whereas 
        character devices do not.
    </p>

    <h3>Using Block Special Device Files</h3>

    <p>
        Operations involving block device files are relatively rare,
        and require superuser permissions.
        Given a new or blank block device, the typical course is 
        to first partition the drive with <code>fdisk</code> or 
        <code>parted</code>, then to create a filesystem on the 
        partition (using perhaps <code>mkfs.ext4</code>, for example), 
        then to mount the filesystem and access the device through 
        the directory tree.
    </p>

    <p>
        Other uses include reading the block device to create 
        a disk image, or writing to it to make use of a disk image.
        Through the device file, such operations can be carried out
        with ordinary user-space tools.

<div class="content" id="pseudo-files">
    <h2>Pseudo Files</h2>

    <p>
        The Linux kernel augments the traditional Unix directory tree with
        <em>pseudo</em> (or "synthetic") files, in
        <code>/proc</code> and <code>/sys</code>.
        These files do not exist on disk, and do not exist on 
        any persistent storage. 
        Instead, their contents are generated dynamically 
        by the kernel as processes interact with them.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, <code>/proc/meminfo</code> contains a 
        description of the the system's current memory usage:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ cat /proc/meminfo<br>
        MemTotal:        3887988 kB<br>
        MemFree:         1619568 kB<br>
        MemAvailable:    2450268 kB<br>
        Buffers:          120152 kB<br>
        Cached:           984208 kB<br>
        SwapCached:            0 kB<br>
        Active:           324532 kB<br>
        Inactive:        1528196 kB<br>
        Active(anon):       9476 kB<br>
        Inactive(anon):  1061224 kB<br>
        [...]
    </div>

    <p>
        When <code>cat</code> reads the file <code>/proc/meminfo</code>,
        the kernel generates the above data, which is then
        printed to <code>STDOUT</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>/proc</code> contains one directory for each 
        process (running program) on the system; therein, each directory 
        contains substantial information about its respective process.
        <code>/sys</code> contains information useful to only the
        lowest-level system daemons.<sup><a href="http://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter09/udev.html">[4]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Other File Types:</strong>

    <ul style="width: 70%; margin-left: 5%;">
        <li>
            <strong>FIFO:</strong> Also known as a <em>named pipe,</em> 
            this is a file type that connects one running program to another.
            "FIFO" stands for <em>First in, first out</em>.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Socket:</strong> A file that supports interprocess 
            communication across networks.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Michael Kerrisk has called the Unix file interface,
        "The Universal I/O Model," and for good reason.
        The four file operations apply to all file types except
        directories, whose structure (a tree) is protected by the
        kernel through a distinct set of system calls.
    </p>

    <!--
        Additionally, older Unix systems entertained directories as
        simple regular files, but since ___ they h

    <h4>and Directories</h4>

    <p>
        Basic utilities to manipulate files:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>touch</code> - Change file timestamps.
        Can be used to create new and empty files.</li>
        <li><code>cp</code> - Copy files and directories</li>
        <li><code>rm</code> - Remove files or directories</li>
        <li><code>mv</code> - Move (rename) files</li>
        <li><code>chown</code> - Change file owner and group</li>
        <li><code>chmod</code> - Change access permissions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Utilities to manipulate file contents:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>cat</code> - Concatenate files and print on the standard output</li>
        <li><code>head</code> - Output the first part of a file</li>
        <li><code>wc</code> - Print newline, word and byte counts</li>
        <li><code>sort</code> - Sort text files</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directories</h3>


    <ul>
        <li><code>mkdir</code> - Make directories</li>
        <li><code>rmdir</code> - Remove empty directories</li>
        <li><code>readlink</code> - Print value of symlink or canonical file name</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The contents of directories are protected by the kernel.
        Each directory contains at least two entries: <code>.</code> ("dot"),
        and <code>..</code> ("dot dot").
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>.</code> is a reference to the containing directory itself.
        It is used by processes as a handle to the current working directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>..</code> is a reference to the containing directory's 
        parent directory.
        Since each (and every) directory has a single parent, the
        directory structure forms a tree.
    </p>

    <h3>Hidden Files</h3>

    <p>
        By convention alone, all filenames beginning with <code>.</code>
        are considered hidden, including <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>.
        They can be listed with <code>ls</code> by the <code>-a</code>
        ("all") switch:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ ls -a

    <p>
        Within any Unix-like operating system, some common themes will be found.
        For instance, <code>bin</code> directories are found in several places, such as
        <code>/bin</code>, <code>/sbin</code>, along with <code>/usr/bin</code>
        and often <code>/home/<i>user</i>/bin</code> as well.
        These contain binary executable files&ndash; programs&ndash; such as
        <code>bash</code> and <code>ls</code>.
        Other standard directories include <code>/root</code>, the root user's home
        directory, and <code>/proc</code>, and <code>/dev</code> as
        mentioned above.
        Some of these have been standard since Unix's inception,
        while others have become standard in more recent years.

            and was developed with help from the BSD development community.<sup><a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch07s02.html">[6]</a></sup>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Let's begin at the top.
        Each Unix-like operating system has a single directory, <code>/</code>,
        which is the root of the directory tree.
        Every file on the system may be addressed in 
        absolute terms by giving its location relative to this
        directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>/home</code> contains users' home directories.
        As user <em>josh</em>, my home directory is <code>/home/josh</code>.
        This path is commonly abbreviated to <code>~</code>.
        By default, it contains the usual "Music", "Movies", "Pictures" and
        "Downloads".
        Per-user configuration files are stored here&mdash; as either
        hidden files or in the directory <code>~/.config</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The directory <code>/etc</code> contains
        system-specific configuration files.
        For example, <code>/etc/passwd</code> contains essential information
        about each user on the system (but not their password, anymore).
        In addition, the configuration of
        the package manager is stored here, 
        and, well, etcetera.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>/tmp</code>, <code>/run</code>,  and <code>/var</code> each hold
        transient files of running programs.
        <code>/boot</code> holds everything required for the boot sequence,
        including my very own Linux kernel:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ file /boot/Image<br>
        Image:&emsp;&emsp; Linux kernel ARM64 boot executable Image, little-endian, 4k pages
    </div>

    <p>
        This kernel is loaded in early boot, after which the file is 
        no longer needed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Software libraries are kind of boring, but essential to modern systems.
        The basic idea is to factor out repeated code (for instance,
        C's <code>printf</code> function) not just from the source code, but
        from <em>executable</em> files as well.
        This means that, when a bug or security vulnerability is found in
        <code>printf</code>, any program that uses the function will not
        have to be recompiled; rather, the appropriate library can be adjusted,
        and all dependant programs can continue operation in blissful ignorance
        of the change.
        Such executable files are said to be <em>dynamically linked,</em>
        and cannot be expected to run properly without their dependencies.
        <code>/lib</code> holds libraries.
    </p>

    <p>
        The last directory we will look at is <code>/usr</code>, which
        is more interesting. It contains user-shared files, such as
        man pages (in <code>/usr/share/man</code>) and most of the system's
        programs (in <code>/usr/bin</code>).
        These files are shared by all system users, and are mostly
        read-only. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Several utilities exist to help locate files; one of my
        favorites is <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/whereis.1.html">whereis</a></code>, available in the
        <em>util-linux</em> package.

    <h2>Mounting a Filesystem</h2>

    <p>
        As mentioned, Unix-like operating systems maintain a single 
        directory tree for the entire system.
        When a new device is introduced to the machine, 
        its directory tree must be placed in the system's existing
        directory tree.
        This operation is known as
        <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3192/what-is-meant-by-mounting-a-device-in-linux"><em>mounting</em></a>.
        Let's take a look at this, for it is new.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suppose we have a usb stick with some music on it. 
        When we plug it into the machine, a file representing
        the device appears in <code>/dev</code>, but
        its contents are not yet available.
    </p>

    <p>
        Assuming the device is named <code>/dev/usb</code>,
        we could mount it like so:
    </p>

    <img style="width:80%" src="assets/img/mounting.png">

    <p>
        The Linux Filesystem Heirarchy Standard provides two places to mount
        temporary filesystems: <code>/mnt</code> and <code>/media/[user]</code>.
        When mounting new devices manually, the usual method is to identify the
        device with
        <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lsblk.8.html"><code>lsblk</code></a>,
        then mount it with
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ sudo mount <i>device</i> <i>mountpoint</i>
    </div>

    <p>
        Superuser priveledges allow us to mount a filesystem anywhere.
        When a filesystem is mounted to a directory that is not empty,
        those directory's contents become hidden by those of the new filesystem,
        and are inaccessible while the filesystem is mounted.
        Therefore, we typically create an empty directory in the existing
        directory tree, to serve as the to-be mounted filesystem's root
        directory.

<div class="content" id="inodes">
    <h2>inodes</h2>
    <!--
        whose structure (a tree) is protected by the kernel through 
        a distinct set of system calls.  
    -->

    <p>
        In keeping with traditional Unix file semantics, 
        every file on a GNU/Linux system is represented by a unique <em><a href="http://www.linfo.org/inode.html">inode</a>.</em><sup><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html#id1">[7]</a></sup>
        Inodes are the responsibility of their respective filesystem,
        wherein each is addressed by a number.
        Within a filesystem, an inode number identifies an
        inode, and thereby identifies a particular file.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <em>directory</em> is a file that associates filenames (strings) with 
        inode numbers:
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Remember:</h4>
        <p>
            Every path on the directory tree terminates in an inode reference.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="code">
        $ ls -ia ~/Public/Learning-Linux <br>
        645278 ./<br>
        384844 ../<br>
        775487 assets/<br>
        641473 command-line-1-tutorial-introduction.html<br>
        645403 _config.yml<br>

        641460 finding-files.html<br>
        775463 _future/<br>
        [...]
    </div>

    <p>
        Each such association is called a <em>hard link.</em>
        A hard link is created upon file creation.
        We can also create new hard links with the <code>ln</code> command,
        as the following sequence demonstrates:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ echo -n "Hello " &gt; newfile <br>
        $ ln newfile 2file <br>
        $ ls -i newfile 2file <br>
        2112949 newfile <br>
        2112949 2file <br>
    </div>

    <p>
        The name <code>2file</code> refers to the same file as
        <code>newfile</code>.
        If we modify the file using one name,
        then we have modified the file referred to by the other:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ echo "world!" &gt;&gt; 2file<br>
        $ cat newfile<br>
        Hello world!
    </div>

    <p>
        A file may have more than one hard link, but when it has zero,
        it is no longer accessible through the directory tree, and
        the kernel prepares to delete it.<sup><a href="#references">[8]</a></sup>

    <h2>The Original Unix Filesystem</h2>

    <p>
        The inode was implemented literally in the Research Unix filesystem,
        and formed the basis of its architecture:
    </p>

    <a href="./assets/img/inode.pdf"><img src="./assets/img/inode.png"></a>

    <p>
        In the design, data blocks are of fixed size, and either free or
        wholly consumed by a file.<sup><a href="#references">[9]</a></sup>
        The filesystem's <em>inodes</em> represent one file each,
        contain their file's metadata, and contain pointers to data blocks.<sup><a href="#references">[9]</a></sup>
        These nodes are arranged in an array, and can be identified
        by an index into this array.
    </p>

    <p>
        The design allows a file to grow or shrink without rearranging
        other files.<sup><a href="#references">[9]</a></sup>
        In addition, the inclusion of single-, double- and triple-
        indirection blocks allow the inode to remain of fixed,
        reasonable size, while supporting large
        files.<sup><a href="#references">[9]</a></sup>
        Finally, by using direct pointers for the first bytes of a file,
        and by keeping the inode array in main memory, 
        the design fosters the speedy retrieval of data in small
        files.<sup><a href="#references">[9]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        It was the most advanced filesystem of its time,
        and, as Unix grew in popularity, 
        the semantics of file operations in Unix-like operating systems
        became dependant upon them.
        The design was demonstrated in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix">MINIX</a> filesystem,
        which in turn served as Linux's pre-1.0 filesystem.
        The <em>extended</em> filesystem, <code>ext</code>, extended
        those filesystem's capabilities.
        With <code>ext</code>'s inclusion in kernel 0.96c, Linux began to use
        its new <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html">Virtual File System</a>,
        a kernel subsystem that provides a
        uniform filesystem interface.
    </p>

    <p>
        While each filesystem implements its own functionality,
        most functionality is common;
        the Virtual File System maps system calls 
        to filesystem-driver functions.
        In addition, the VFS imposes inodes on filesystems that do not
        natively employ them, thereby preserving traditional Unix file
        semantics across all supported filesystems.
