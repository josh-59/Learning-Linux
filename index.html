        This website presents an introduction to GNU/Linux, the fast, free 
        operating system that puts users in control. 
        While intended for the new user, it does not 
        shy away from rigorously developing the subject.
        Enjoy!

    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
        The desire for this work&mdash; a concise introduction to
        Linux&mdash; emerged as I began my own Linux journey.  At the time, I was
        reading books like "The Linux Command Line" and 
        "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment".  
        Despite all the books I read, none of them
        were "good" in the sense of being satisfactory to me, as a new user.
    </p>

    <p>
        The situation was epitomized in an interaction with my computer science
        professor of the time.  I asked him, pretty straightforwardly, if he could
        recommend any books on Linux.  He responded, "Gosh, there are a jillion
        of them."  And I can remember thinking, "I don't need a jillion of them,
        I need one good one."
    </p>

    <p>
        And so, later, during my last semester of university, when we were tasked
        with creating a website about the subject of our choice, I elected to 
        write about Linux.  The original title was, "Need to Know"; 
        it was intended to present the bare essentials of the operating system,
        clearly.  The work was so bad that the professor admitted
        that I was being graded on the website's form, layout and features, and 
        not its content.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In the spirit of making something "good", I continued to work with
        it, writing chunks and throwing them out.  I like to think of this as a living
        document, it being the case that it can always be improved.  Know, above
        all else, that I'm just some guy who's spent some time learning about
        Linux, who also likes to write.
