            Recall that <a href="files-and-filesystems.html#regular-files">a file</a> is a sequence of bytes.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        A process is an instance of an executing program.<sup><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
        A <em>program</em> (also known as an "executable file")
        contains the information required to
        construct a process.<sup><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup>
        The  process is, after the <em>file,</em> the most important
        abstraction of operating systems.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="content" id="actors">

    <h2> Actors </h2>

    <p>
        Think of processes as the actors of the operating system.
        Left to its own devices, the kernel does nothing:
        All Unix-like operating systems depend upon processes to direct the kernel,
        and through the kernel, processes direct the machine.
        The result is a clear demarcation between
        <em>what</em> to do (dictated by processes), and <em>how</em> to do
        it (dictated by the kernel).
    </p>



    <p>
        The kernel:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Facilitates new process creation
        </li>
        <li>
            Allocates hardware resources to each process
        </li>
        <li>
            Maintains information about processes
        </li>
        <li>
            Facilitates change of their attributes
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        There are processes for every function on the system.
        There's one for the network manager,
        another for the desktop environment,
        another acting as a printer spooler, etc..
        If you're working at the command line, then there is one process
        acting as a terminal emulator, and another acting as a shell.
        Without a process, the kernel is unreachable, and the system is static.
    </p>

    <p>
        Under the Unix philosophy, each process has a narrowly defined role,
        which it is expected to do well.  It might copy a file, list the
        contents of a directory, or interpret and execute commands from the user.
    </p>

    <h3> Runlevels</h3>
    <p>
        Historically, collections of running processes were
        called <a href="http://www.linfo.org/runlevel_def.html">runlevels</a>;
        different runlevels offered different services, and therefore
        were intended to be used for different situations.
        In particular, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/single_user_mode.html">single-user mode</a>
        was (and is) analogous to <em>safe boot,</em> and <em>runlevel 0</em>
        quits all processes in preparation for system shutdown.
    </p>

<div class="content" id="proccess-creation">
    <h2> Process Creation and System Startup</h2>

    <p>
        At the end of the boot sequence, the kernel launches a single program,
        <code>/sbin/init</code>.<sup><a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/intro-linux.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
        While init schemes <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2748">have evolved</a> over the years,
        their purpose has not changed:  It is a process with root-level permissions that acts as a
        trustee among processes; its central responsibility is to bring up
        userspace.<sup><a href="http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/systemd.html">[4]</a></sup>
        After <em>init</em>, process creation is delegated to processes themselves.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            You can check your <em>init</em> program with <br> <center><code>$ ps --pid 1</code></center><br>
            <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/">systemd</a> is very common today.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        From within a process, creating a new process begins with
        the <em><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">fork()</a></em> system call.
        This instructs the kernel to make a copy of the current process&mdash;
        an exact copy is produced, save one difference: Each of the two
        processes receives a different return value from <em>fork().</em>
        The video below explains the <em>fork()</em> system call well.
    </p>

    <p>
        The new process is called the <em>child</em> process; the
        old process is called the <em>parent</em> process.
        The parent process usually goes on about its business, such as managing other
        user-space processes, or querying the user
        for a new line of input.
        The child goes on to call <em><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(pathname, argv, envp)</a>.</em>
        This instructs the kernel to replace the current
        process with a new one by loading the executable file located at <em>pathname;</em>
        therein, execution begins at <em>main.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Before the calls to <em>fork</em> and <em>exec()</em>, there was one process.
        After <em>fork()</em>, there are two nearly-duplicate processes.
        After <em>exec()</em>, there are two distinct processes.
        Note: Any process, including child processes, may call <em>fork()</em> and <em>exec()</em>.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="content" id="process-attributes">
    <h2> Process Attributes </h2>
    <p>
        Upon birth, each process is given its own process id (PID) number by the kernel.
        This is guaranteed to be unique to the process, remains constant throughout
        the process's life, and serves as the kernel's handle
        to the process.
        Pragmatically speaking, process ID's begin at
        <code>1</code> (with <em>init</em>) and count upwards until
        <code>/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max - 1</code>.<sup><a href="kerrisk, p.115">[6]</a></sup>
        After that, the kernel begins searching at <code>300</code> for the next free PID.<sup><a href="kerrisk, p.115">[6]</a></sup>
        That is, PID's are not guaranteed to be monotonically increasing.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are a few reasons to manage processes by PID numbers rather than names.
        First, two processes spawned from the same executable can easily,
        and often, exist.
        If we launch two instances of Firefox, for instance, then two distinct
        processes exist.
        The only thing they share is the <code>text</code> segment of the program,
        which contains the program's instructions, and which exists in the virtual
        memory of each process as read-only.
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond PID, each process on the system has:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Current working directory</li>
        <li>File Access Permissions</li>
        <li>Environment variables</li>
        <li>Its own directory in <code>/proc</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>

</div>

<div class="content" id="sandbox">
  <h2>Sandbox</h2>
  <p>
    One of the major ideas of processes is that each process is isolated
    from both the kernel and from other processes.
    This is done for a few reasons.
    First, we want to ensure that no process is capable of jeopardizing the
    stability of the system.
    Second, we want to ensure that no process can affect any other process
    in an unpredictable manner.
    We do this by running each process in a "sandboxed" environment, composed
    of restricted access to the machine's CPU, and a virtualized memory address
    space.
  </p>

  <h3> Limited Direct Execution </h3>

  <p>
    Modern CPU architectures support two
    distinct modes of operation.
    <em>Kernel mode,</em> sometimes called "supervisor mode," is the unrestricted mode.
    Here, all CPU instructions are available, so that code running in this mode
    has complete access to the machine.
    <em>User mode</em> is a proper subset of kernel mode; all processes run in user mode.
    If a process, running in user mode, attempts to execute a restricted instruction,
    its execution is halted, and control is given to the kernel.
    At that point, it is up to the operating system to determine what to do
    (usually, terminate the offending process).
  </p>

  <p>
    This technique is known as <em>limited direct execution.</em><sup><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-mechanisms.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
    It is <em>limited</em> in the sense that each process has access to
    only a restricted subset of the CPU's instructions.
    It is <em>direct</em> in the sense that each process runs directly on hardware.
    It makes safe and efficient use of available hardware.
  </p>

  <p>
    For instance, no process can access a hard-drive directly.
    The proper avenue for a process to access such a device is through the kernel,
    via system calls.
    Through limited direct execution, this is
    <em>the only</em> way that a process can access it.
    This ensures that the kernel remains in charge of the machine's state.
  </p>

  <h3> Virtual Memory </h3>

  <p>
    Modern operating systems provide each process with its own memory in the
    form of a distinct <em>address space.</em>
    An address space is a collection of memory addresses; on all modern architectures,
    memory (RAM) is byte-addressable, so that each address refers to exactly one byte.
    Addresses themselves are simply numbers, usually expressed in hexadecimal.
  </p>

<a style="outline: solid black 2px; " title="Traced by User:Stannered, original by en:User:Dysprosia / BSD (http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Virtual_address_space_and_physical_address_space_relationship.svg"><img width="512" alt="Virtual address space and physical address space relationship" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Virtual_address_space_and_physical_address_space_relationship.svg/512px-Virtual_address_space_and_physical_address_space_relationship.svg.png"></a>
  </div>

  <p>
    Some archaic operating systems (such as the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exec_(Amiga)">Amiga</a>)
    allowed processes direct access to
    the system's main memory; processes effectively shared the same address space.
    This posed significant issues for system stability and security&mdash;
    namely, one process could read and/or manipulate the memory of another.
  </p>

  <p>
  <em>Modern operating systems provide each process with a distinct
      address space.</em>
    The result has been a profound improvement in system stability.
    The addresses that any process uses are relative to that process alone;
    they are called "virtual" because they exist, effectively, for that process alone.
    These virtual addresses are mapped onto physical addresses by
    the CPU, without the process ever being aware of it.
    This scheme is referred to colloquially as "virtual memory."
  </p>

  <p>
    The virtual memory abstraction requires support from both the kernel
    and CPU.
    For each process, the kernel maintains an address translation table, which maps
    virtual addresses onto physical ones.
    This is loaded onto the CPU's
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit">Memory Management Unit</a>
    whenever the process runs,
    and the MMU carries out address translation automatically whenever in user mode.
  </p>

  <p>
    Crucially, not every virtual address needs to be mapped to a physical address.
    Rather, when a process references a virtual address that is not mapped,
    the MMU instructs the CPU to interrupt execution of the process; the CPU
    defers control to the kernel.
    If the memory address should be mapped, the kernel loads that data into memory,
    modifies the translation table and returns control to the process.
    If the memory should not be mapped (i.e., it is an undefined address), the
    kernel aborts execution of the program.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through the mechanism of virtual memory, each process is presented with
    the illusion that it has the entirety of the machine's memory to
    itself.
    Other processes are implicitly protected from memory tampering:
    Their memory simply does not exist within the context of the
    currently running process, and therefore cannot be read from, nor written to.
    As with limited direct execution, virtual memory facilitates
    the safe and efficient use of a machine resource.

<div id="closing-remarks" class="content">
    <h2> Closing Remarks </h2>

  <h3> Dynamic vs. Static </h3>
  <p>
    We pause our discussion to give definitions of the words <em>dynamic</em> and <em>static.</em>
    An action occurs dynamically with respect to a process if it occurs during process
    execution.
    For instance, the kernel creates files <em>dynamically,</em> since the
    only way to create a file is to have a process make an appropriate
    <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open(2)</a> system call.
    Similarly, the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a> library function
    allocates memory dynamically.
  </p>

  <p>
    The obverse of dynamic is <em>static:</em>
    For any given process, an element of the programming environment is static with respect to the process if it is invariant
    throughout program execution.
    For instance, the CPU architecture of a machine is static for each process on it.
    Note that the contents of a file may be dynamic, or they may be static.
  </p>

  <h3> <code>strace</code> </h3>

  <p>
      A powerful utility to investigate the actions of a process is
      <code><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html">strace</a></code>, which executes the process and captures
      all of its system calls.
      These system calls are then listed and printed to standard error;
      they include the arguments to the system call, in addition to its return value.
      For example, the first line of an <code>strace</code> of a Python script of mine:
  </p>

  <div class="code">
      execve("./ttable.py", ["./ttable.py"], 0x7ffd1af464a0 /* 54 vars */) = 0
