  <h1>Processes</h1>
  <h4>Under Construction!</h4>

  <p>
    A process is a running program<sup><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-intro.pdf">[1]</a></sup>.
    A <em>program</em> is a file containing a range of information that describes how to
    construct a process at run time<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>.
    Modern operating systems, including GNU/Linux, are multiprocess operating systems, supporting
    multiple processes concurrently.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are processes for every function on the system.
    There's one for the network manager,
    another for the desktop environment,
    another acting as a printer spooler, etc..
    On GNU/Linux operating systems, all aspects of processes, except launching them,
    are the responsibility of the the kernel.
    In this way, the kernel supports the use of the machine,
    without making stipulations on its use.
  </p>

  <p>
    The kernel:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li> Facilitates new process creation </li>
    <li> Allocates hardware resources to each process </li>
    <li> Facilitates communication between processes </li>
    <li> Maintains metadata about processes </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Processes are <em>actors</em> of the system.
  </p>

<div class="content">
  <h2> Fork / Exec </h2>

  <p>
    Like all interactions with the kernel, instructing the kernel to generate a new
    process takes place through the system call interface.




  <p>
    The Unix kernel executes exactly one program, <em>init</em>.

        The Linux kernel facilitates process creation, supports existing processes,
        and launches exactly one, but otherwise pays no attention to processes;
        there's a very clear division of responsibilities, here:
        The kernel will exist with zero processes.
        It would, however, be impossible to interact with, and hence, useless.
