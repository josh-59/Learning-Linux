  <h4>Under Construction!</h4>

  <p>
    A major theme of the GNU/Linux operating system is that abstractions are maintained
    by the kernel for both users and programmers.
    As one studies these abstractions, the details of their implementation
    become increasingly complex, and also increasingly irrelevant:
    Each abstraction is maintained precisely so that its details may be ignored.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Linux kernel is written in C, and as such, the "native tongue"
    of each system call is C.
    For example, when querying the kernel about a file through the system
    call <em><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html">stat</a>,</em>
    a C struct is returned.
  </p>

<div id="c" class="content">
  <h2> C </h2>
  <p>
    C is the <em>lingua franca</em> of
    programming.<sup><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Required_Knowledge">[1]</a><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
      As such, it would be a mistake to put any other programming language first.
    C is not a large language, but is difficult to master.
    It is often called "portable assembly" because it closely
    mirrors the abstractions of the machine itself.<sup><a href="https://youtu.be/HgtRAbE1nBM?t=1021">[4]</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    A central feature of the language, and the principal reason for its
    difficulty, is that C expects the programmer to manually (explicitly)
    address memory, through variables called <em>pointers.</em>
    Moreover, memory is often allocated and deallocated manually (explicitly)
    by the programmer.
    With this combination, there are many possible avenues of failure, including
    syntax errors, dangling pointers, double-free'ing, and
    the glorious segmentation fault.
  </p>

  <p>
    The C Programming Language shows its age in a few ways.
    First, its command-line interface is not unified.
    There is a preprocessor, separate from the compiler; there is also a linker and an assembler.
    While <code>gcc</code> executes each of these for you in a single step,
    it is not as slick an interface as Mozilla Rust's <em>cargo</em> utility,
    which, in addition to the above, also handles packaging and make-ing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another way that C shows its age is, well, its memory management.
    Each language since has, to my mind, first decreed their own philosophy regarding memory&mdash;
    i.e., "This is how <em>we're</em> going to handle memory."
    Each new philosophy carries its own set of problems.
    Garbage collection is too slow and unpredictable for systems programming,
    and Rust's "zero-cost abstractions" require a nontrivial understanding of
    the language's idea of ownership.
  </p>

  <p>
    C is a great language.
    The only documentation a programmer requires is <em>The C Programming Language,</em>
    by Ken Thompson and Brian Kerningham, the language's creators.
    This book is commonly known as <em>K&R.</em>
    You require the second edition.

  <h2>Other Systems Programming Languages</h2>
  <p>
    The C language belongs to a class of programming languages known as
    <em>systems programming languages:</em> It is suitable for use in
    the production of non-application software, such as drivers and kernels.
    While there have been many attempts to supersede C, I wish to discuss only two.
  </p>

  <h3> C++ </h3>
  <p>
    Stay away from C++.
    Originally, this language was called <em>C with Classes,</em> and this name
    reflects an attempt to augment the C language by arbitrarily introducing
    object-oriented programming (via classes).
    The result is a very large, very complicated language.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two issues with using such a language.
    First, because C is fully supported within C++,
    and C is a complete language, C++ is redundantly complete.
    Anywhere you might use C++, you can instead use C.
    Second, in practice, the tendency is to use only a portion of the full
    language, meaning that handy features go unused, simply because they are
    not known.
  </p>

  <h3> Rust </h3>
  <p>
    I <em>really like</em> Rust.  I truly believe that it is the systems programming
    language of the next 20 years.

Finally, my preferred verb for using system calls is <em>direct,</em>
as in, "We <em>direct</em> the kernel to create a new file via the
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open</a> system call."
