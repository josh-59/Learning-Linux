    <h1>Learning Linux </h1>
    <h4>A Tour Through Documentation</h4>

    <p>
        Linux is a very large subject.
        Although there are many sources of documentation, they are not,
        in general, well-organized, so that finding the right information
        can be hard.
        This paper aims to give an overview of available resources,
        some examples of each, and useful pointers, where appropriate.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="how-to" class="content">
    <h2>How-to</h2>
    <p>
        It's one of the great failings of modern computer culture to
        suggest that being new or trying to learn is embarassing.
    </p>

    <ol class="big-list">
        <li>
            <i>Figure out what your question is.</i>
            <p>
                This can be more difficult than you might guess, because you might
                honestly not know how to phrase your question.
                Be specific!
                Things are very well-defined in computers.
                This stands in great
                contrast to intuitive conceptions of their operation.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <i>What would answer your question?  </i>
            <ul style="list-style-type: '- '">
                <li> An Example </li>
                <li> A Precise Explanation</li>
                <li> A Detailed Description </li>
                <li> Theoretical Discussion </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>Revise.</i>
            <p>
                Do you need more information? Or less?
                You might need something immediately
                useful rather than theoretically correct.
                Conversely, you might find that your practical knowledge is
                lacking some kind of <i>body</i>; in this case, you are
                looking to frame your knowledge in appropriate theory.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>Be Patient.</i>
            <p>
                Skill accrues.
                Answer one question at a time.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div id="man-pages" class="content">
    <h2> Man Pages </h2>
    <p>
        By far the most useful asset in the Linux documentation chain is the
        manual ("man") pages.
        They are concise, immediate, and generally aim to answer as many
        questions as quickly as possible.
        However, they tend to be more "handy" than "exhaustive," so they might
        not answer your question.
    </p>

    <p>
        Man pages are accessed at the command line so:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        man app
    </div>

    <p>
        You can search through available man pages with the <code>apropos</code> command,
        as in,
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        apropos decompress
    </div>

    <p>
        Technically speaking, this utility searches the single-line, "short description"
        of each man page, and prints out the names and descriptions of programs that match your search
        (<code>man apropos</code> for more information).
    </p>

    <p>
        Once within the <code>man</code> utility, you can search the current page
        by typing a forward slash, then your search term:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        /&lt;search-term&gt;
    </div>

    <p>
        Then type a single <b>n</b> to jump to the next result.
        Many of the controls of the man-pages coincide with those of
        the <code>less</code> paging utility, and with those of the <code>vi/vim</code>
        text editor, so they're worth learning.
        For instance, move down the page one line by typing <b>j</b>.
        Move up the page one line by typing <b>k</b>.
        And, move down a screenful by hitting the spacebar.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right" style="margin-left: 25pt; padding-bottom: 0">
        <h4>Manual Sections:</h4>
        <ol style="margin-left:0">
            <li> Shell Commands </li>
            <li> Systems Calls </li>
            <li> C Library Functions </li>
            <li> Special Files </li>
            <li> File Formats and Conventions </li>
            <li> Games </li>
            <li> Miscellaneous</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p>
        Man pages date back to the first implementations of Unix,<sup><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup>
        where they were the user's primary documentation of the newly-minted Unix operating system.
        They often include examples, hints, and useful suggestions
        (such as <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getdents.2.html">"These are not the interfaces you are intered in."</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
        The structure of the manual is worth learning.
        For instance, the manual is divided into sections, so that
        just by looking at the location of a page within the manual, one
        can tell if it's a program that can be called from the command-line,
        a system call, or a C library function;
        <code>man man</code> for more information.
    </p>

    <p>
        Similarly, knowing the structure of the man-pages themselves has
        proven useful.
        For instance, each page has a "See Also" section near the bottom,
        which lists similar or related man pages.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="official-documentation" class="content">
    <h2> Official Documentation </h2>

    <p>
        Official documentation originates from the group or organization
        that is producing the work.
        It is suitably positioned to be both exhaustive and authoritative over the subject at hand.
        Think of offical documentation like the
        <a href="https://primarysources.yale.edu/"> primary sources </a>
        from history class.
        This is by far my favorite form of documentation.
        Nothing makes me feel warmer and fuzzier than downloading
        the <i>Official ________ _________ Reference Manual</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, it's unreasonable to expect people to produce
        such technically meritorious writing in multiple formats simultaneously, such as
        HTML, PDF, etc. (although GNU does an admirable job).
        As a consequence, official documentation
        is typically found in web-page format.
        Moreover, like the projects they are part of,
        official documentation is often community-driven.
    </p>

    <p>
        Several awesome examples spring to mind:
    </p>
    <ul class="big-list">
        <li>
            <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">
                The Rust Progamming Language</a>&mdash;
                Written by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols with updates from the community,
                this book is the main documentation of the Rust language.
                I think it's a great book, especially for its
                technical excellence.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://godotengine.org/">
                Godot Open Source Game Engine</a>&mdash;
                Godot is an MIT-licensed open source game engine (and, I daresay, the one you're looking for).
                <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/">Its official documentation</a> is community-driven.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html"> GNU's official documentation</a> is
            both supremely authoritative and exhaustive.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/"> Arch Linux's Wiki</a> is great,
            and almost always applies to distributions outside of Arch.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">Mozilla's HTML Docs</a>&mdash;
            Mozilla produces excellent documentation, primarily about web technologies.
            In addition, they help define
            the HTML living standard,<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
            and hence, represent an official voice with respect to modern HTML.
        </li>
    </ul>

</div>

<div id="unofficial-documentation" class="content">
    <h2> Unofficial Documentation </h2>

    <p>
        Most documentation is from unofficial, secondary sources.
        Examples include this website, websites like it, question/answer sites,
        books that are <i>about</i> Linux without being authoritative (which is most of them),
        Youtube videos, podcasts, etc..
        Unofficial documentation is very hit-or-miss, and whether it
        represents a hit for you is largely a matter of taste.
        Think of them like commentary on the subject at hand.
    </p>

    <p>
        Examples of good, unofficial documentation:
        <ul class="big-list">
            <li>
                <a href="http://tldp.org/"> The Linux Documentation Project</a>&mdash; Sadly, this project is not maintained anymore.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php"> The Linux Command Line</a> by William Shotts&mdash; An Introduction to Linux.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://wps.prenhall.com/esm_molay_UNIXProg_1/"> Understanding Unix/Linux Programming: A Guide to Theory and Practice</a>
                by Bruce Molay&mdash;
                A personal favorite, though it is dated.
                It walks the reader through the structure of Linux via programming tutorials.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        There are two big problems with this sort of documentation.
        First, it isn't necessarily authoritative.
        Since it doesn't spring from the source, it is not moderated by the
        creators of the project.
        Second, there's there's just too much of it.
        As my professor said, "There are a gazzillion books on Linux."
    </p>
</div>

<div id="tutorials" class="content">
    <h2> Tutorials </h2>

    <p>
        Tutorials are usually unofficial.
        That being said, they
        are a great form of unofficial documentation,
        because they are informative, concise, and relevant.
        A tutorial jumps right in to the subject at hand.
        However, it's possible to produce a tutorial that is impractical,
        such as, <i>How to Write a Flight Simulator From Scratch</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Good examples:
        <ul class="big-list">
            <li>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/mAbG8Oi-SvQ"> Make an Action RPG in Godot 3.2</a>&mdash;
                A Youtube tutorial for building your own Godot 3.2 game (note, the Godot supplied
                via Debian repository was outdated, at the time of this writing [April 2020], so you might
                need to check your version to get it to work.).
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com"> Learn Markdown</a>&mdash;
                A tutorial guide to markdown.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="https://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/">
                    Making Your Own Ruby Gems</a> &mdash; Walks you through
                    the creation of a Ruby software package (a.k.a., 'gem').
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<div id="videos" class="content">
    <h2> Videos </h2>
    <p>
        Again, these are usually unofficial.
        Videos are addictive because they're easy to digest, but real
        understanding only comes out of real study&mdash;
        Read, study, do!
    </p>

    <p>
        Some channels I like:
        <ul class="big-list">
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrUL8K81R4VBzm-KOYwrcxQ"> Engineer Man</a>&mdash; Linux-related programming content.
                Engineer Man got me off the couch and into some Linux; he's awesome!
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/teksyndicate"> Level1Techs</a>&mdash; Tech news, mostly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg">DistroTube</a>&mdash; Linux distro's, applications.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<div id="reference" class="content">
    <h2> Reference </h2>

    <p>
        There exists one last category of documentation, reference material.
        Technically speaking, it's unofficial documentation.
        That can't stop someone from doing their homework (so to speak).
        Reference material is characterized by being well-researched.
        <i>Good</i>
        reference material is characterized by being laid out well, and
        presenting material that is useful to you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some Suggestions:
        <ul class="big-list">
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.man7.org/tlpi/index.html"> The Linux Programming Interface </a>by Michael Kerrisk&mdash;
                My recommendation
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-UNIX-Operating-System/dp/0132017997"> The Design of the Unix Operating System</a>
                by Maurice J. Bach&mdash; Old-school, somewhat dated.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.apuebook.com/apue3e.html">Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment</a>, by W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago&mdash;
                Highly theoretical, it covers the programming interfaces (system calls) of various standards (POSIX, Single Unix Specification, etc..).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        These are enormous books, most appropriate to the professional, the
        aspiring professional, or the insanely curious.
        As my professor said, these are the sorts of books that you read over
        the course of six months or a year, but which can define your career.
    </p>
