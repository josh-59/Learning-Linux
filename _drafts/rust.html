<h2> Expressive </h2>
<p>
    Rust is an expressive language.  That means:
</p>

    <ol>
        <li>It's enormous</li>
        <li>(Optionally) Everything is an expression</li>
    </ol>

<p>
    Everything in Rust really is an expression, and evaluates to some
    value.  
    The none value is <code>()</code>, the unit tuple; this is the 
    return type of a function which returns nothing, for instance,
    or, the value of an <code>if<code> statement.
</p>

<p>
    "<code>()<code> is a value of the type <code>()</code> and its purpose is
    to be useless," says A.B. the Wise.
    It is an object with size of zero (bytes); and, it stands to reason that
    its existence would have no effect on machine state.
</p>

<p>
    (The Rust compiler is a real bear).
    Matter of fact,
</p>
