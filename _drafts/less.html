    <h4>A Success Story</h4>

    <p>
        A <em>paging utility</em> is a program that displays a file on 
        the terminal one screenful at a time.
        The first widely used paging utility was <code>more</code>, written by
        Dan Halbert as a graduate student at UC Berkley in 1978.<sup><a href="https://danhalbert.org/more.html">[aa]</a></sup>
        <code>more</code> is a relatively simple program: It first 
        fills up the screen, then waits for user input to print the 
        next line(s).

        In 1983, Mark Nudelman was a software developer working for a
        company called Integrated Office Systems. From the <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#history"><code>less</code> FAQ</a>:

    <blockquote>
        Some of our software ran on a Unix system and produced enormous log files
        of its transactions. We wanted to be able to search these log files for
        error messages. But the version of "vi" we were using couldn't handle
        files larger than a certain size, and our log files often exceeded that
        size. So we were forced to use "more" to view the files. The problem was,
        once we found an error message, what we really wanted to see was the
        transactions leading up to the error; that is, the lines in the log file
        immediately before the error message. But more didn't allow backward
        movement in the file.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        We often complained about this problem. We said we needed a "backwards
        more"; someone (it wasn't me, but unfortunately I don't remember who
        it was) coined the name "less" as a joke on the concept of a "backwards
        more". It didn't seem to me that it would be too difficult to write a
        simple pager that would allow forward and backward movement.
        I wrote the first version in late 1983 and we began using it internally.
        I continued to enhance it and finally decided it was a useful enough
        tool that I should make it available to the world. I posted the first
        version to the newsgroup called (at that time) net.sources in May, 1985.

    <blockquote>
        Making the program publicly available allowed an enormous number of
        people to use it. Many people have made their own modifications and
        donated them to me for incorporation into the official version, and
        many more have reported bugs they've found or made suggestions about
        features they'd like to see added. This was my first experience with
        the concept of what is now called "open source" or "free software",
        and it has, I believe, produced a very high quality product. I'd like
        to thank all the users of less for their invaluable comments and
        suggestions over the years. 
        Less wouldn't be what it is today without you.

        Mark Nudelman continues to maintain the project today.  
        It is, at the time of this writing, in its 581<sup>st</sup> 
        version.<sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#version">[q]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/index.html">[r]</a></sup>
