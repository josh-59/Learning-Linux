    <h2> Programs </h2>
    <p>
        A <em>program</em> is a file that instructions describing how
        to construct a process.
        In GNU/Linux, there is no "executable" file type, and there 
        is no extension denoting executable files (e.g., <em>.exe</em>).
        Rather, a program is a regular file with 
        execute permissions.<sup><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/execvp.3p.html">[a]</a></sup>

    <h2>Process Environment</h2>

    <h3> Limited Direct Execution </h3>

    <p>
        Modern CPU architectures support two distinct modes of operation.
        <em>Kernel mode,</em> sometimes called "supervisor mode," is
        the unrestricted mode.
        Here, all CPU instructions are available, and all memory is available,
        so that code running in this mode has complete access to the machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>User mode</em> is a proper subset of kernel mode; code running
        in user mode does not have access to all instructions, and does not
        have access to all memory of the machine.
        All processes run in user mode, and
        if a process, running in user mode, attempts to execute a restricted
        instruction (or address memory not given to it), 
        its execution is halted, and control is given to the kernel.
        At that point, it is up to the operating system to determine what to do
        (usually, terminate the offending process).
    </p>

    <p>
        By restricting user-mode instructions to those that cannot effect system
        stability, processes 
    </p>

    <p>
        This technique is known as <em>limited direct execution.</em><sup><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-mechanisms.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
        It is <em>limited</em> in the sense that each process has access to
        only a restricted subset of the CPU's instructions, and
        it is <em>direct</em> in the sense that each process runs directly on
        hardware.
        It is intended to make safe and efficient use of available hardware.
    </p>


  <h3> Virtual Memory </h3>

  <p>
    Modern operating systems provide each process with its own memory in the
    form of a distinct <em>address space.</em>
    An address space is a collection of memory addresses; on all modern architectures,
    memory is byte-addressable, so that each address refers to exactly one byte.
    Addresses themselves are simply numbers, usually expressed in hexadecimal.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Some archaic operating systems (such as the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exec_(Amiga)">Amiga</a>)
    allowed processes direct access to
    the system's main memory; processes effectively shared the same address space.
    This poses significant issues for system stability and security&mdash;
    namely, one process could read and/or manipulate the memory of another.
  </p>

    <p>
        <em>Modern operating systems provide each process with a distinct
        address space.</em>
        The addresses that any process uses are implicitly restricted to that
        process alone.
        The result has been a profound improvement in system stability.
    </p>

  <p>
    The virtual memory abstraction requires support from both the kernel
    and CPU:
    For each process, the kernel maintains an address translation table, which maps
    virtual addresses onto physical ones.
    This is loaded onto the CPU's
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit">Memory Management Unit</a>
    whenever the process runs,
    and the MMU carries out address translation automatically whenever in user mode.
  </p>

  <p>
    Crucially, not every virtual address needs to be mapped to a physical address.
    Rather, when a process references a virtual address that is not mapped,
    the MMU instructs the CPU to interrupt execution of the process; the CPU
    defers control to the kernel.
    If the memory address should be mapped, the kernel loads that data into memory,
    modifies the translation table and returns control to the process.
    If the memory should not be mapped (i.e., it is an undefined address), the
    kernel aborts execution of the program.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through the mechanism of virtual memory, each process is presented with
    the illusion that it has the entirety of the machine's memory to
    itself.
    Other processes are implicitly protected from memory tampering:
    Their memory simply does not exist within the context of the
    currently running process, and therefore cannot be read from, nor written to.
    As with limited direct execution, virtual memory is intended to
    facilitate the safe and efficient use of a machine resource.
  </p>

    <h3>Concurrency:</h3>

    <p>
        For processes, access to the CPU is also restricted in a temporal sense:
        Each process is allotted some time to run, and when its time is up,
        the kernel interrupts execution, saves the state of the process (precisely),
        and loads a different process to run.
        That one runs for a bit, and then it too is interupted, and a new
        process allowed to run for a while.
        This is known as a <em>context switch,</em> and is the root
        of multiprocessing
    </p>


    <p>
        This environment is composed of restricted access to the CPU,
        and a distinct memory space.
        Simply put, a process can neither modify another process's memory,
        nor can it modify the kernel's memory, because <em>that memory does not
        exist within the context of the process.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        The program is thus isolated, and can do anything it likes, within
        its own "sandbox" environment.

    <p>
        A binary executable is a program stored in a format that is 
        natively executable by the host computer.
        Building one from a high-level language is a multistep process, but
        performance is effectively maximized.  
        Preparing a process to execute a binary is known as <em>loading.</em>

        <li> Data&mdash; Initial values for global and static variables</li>

            assigned arithmetic zero by the kernel upon loading</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        To execute a program stored in this format, the kernel
        simply copies its data to the process's virtual memeory and 
        assigns the CPU's program counter to point to the first instruction 
        therein.
