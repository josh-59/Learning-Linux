    <h2>Redirection</h2>

    <p>
        One of the features that makes the Unix command-line interface
        powerful is the ability to direct output away from the terminal.
        Since the terminal is represented as a file, 
        the operations on it and any other file are identical.
        Thus, by changing the file before calling the command,
        we can easily capture its output in a regular file;
        the command does not need to know:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ lscpu &gt; cpu_stats
    </div>

    <p>
        This is called <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html">redirection</a>.</em> 
        The shell creates the file <code>cpu_stats</code> 
        if it does not exist, and assigns it to be the output file of
        <code>lscpu</code>.
        For reasons we'll dive into later, any error messages produced
        by <code>lscpu</code> will still be printed to the terminal.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can also direct the output of one command
        to be the input of another, forming a <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pipelines.html">pipeline</a></em>:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ apropos make | less
    </div>

    <p>
        The redirection operators <code>&gt;</code> and <code>|</code>
        are not arguments, and are not passed to their respective commands.
        In fact, <code>apropos</code> does not even know about <code>less</code>!
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, if we want to discard the output of a command or
        pipeline, we can redirect it to <code>/dev/null</code>.
    </p>
