    <h2>Supporting Success</h2>
    <h4>How-to Collaborate</h4>

    <p>
        As mentioned, free software is not necessarily the work
        of collaboration. 
        However, by the tenants of software freedom alone, every user is a 
        potential developer;
        consequently, being open to collaboration is a good way of supporting
        project success.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although participation in project development is, admittedly, unlikely, 
        given the large user-bases that free software garners, it does
        occur.
        In practice, meritocracy transpires:
        As individuals contribute to a project, trust in their work improves, 
        and their work eventually becomes adopted as standard.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is seen in Linux kernel development as a "tree of trust"&mdash;
        a contributor to a particular kernel subsystem eventually 
        becomes its maintainers, whereupon modifications to the
        subsystem are expected to pass through them.
        Meritocracy is 
        <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy">formally recognized</a> 
        by the Apache Software Foundation as a principle of its organization.
    </p>

    <p>
        In practice, being open to contribution with respect to people and 
        to institutions fosters project success.
        While individual commits are 
        <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cs/linux-incident">not necessarily</a>
        produced in good faith, the law of large numbers dictates that
        enough of them will result in real, appreciable improvement.
    </p>

    <p>        Real software&mdash; that is, the software we the community use every
        day&mdash; has been under development for decades.
        - More, a project whose development outpaces others is usually
        preferred over its counterparts.

        If you do wish to contribute a modification to a project, 
        then you have a few responsibilities:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Write code that can be read easily
                <ul>
                    <li>Code is read much more often than it is written</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Write code that can be improved
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep it simple</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Write code that is modular
                <ul>
                    <li>Account for future development</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        But most of all, do one thing and do it well.
    </p>

    <p>
        Smaller projects, in keeping with their lower rate of change,
            release whenever they're ready.
            Larger projects (e.g., Firefox) usually <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar">schedule releases</a>, 
        this being a kind way to keep many disconnected individuals on the same
        page.
    </p>

    <p>
        The result is said to be <em>community driven,</em> and while
        money is secondary, developers still have to eat.
        Most (if not all) projects happily accept donations.
        Larger projects often create a (501(c)3) nonprofit foundation to
        monetarily support its community.
        Finally, a relatively well-established and agreeable way of
        generating funds is what 
        Clement Lefebvre of Linux Mint termed the "radio station" model:
        Rather than sell a product (or offer service-and-support),
        the project is supported by donations and ad revenue from users'
        default home page.
        The idea is that use of the product itself produces monetary
        support, which can be put back into the project.
