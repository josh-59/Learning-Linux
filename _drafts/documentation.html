	<h1>Documentation</h1>

    <p>
        The first versions of the Linux kernel were released in late 1991,
        at which point producing an operating system around it was very much
        a do-it-yourself affair.
        In 1992, as the kernel's user base began to grow, the first documentation
        about it began to appear.
        Called <em>The Linux FAQ,</em> it was distributed as a single large
        file, split into sections;
        from this, the <a href="https://tldp.org">Linux Documentation Project</a> grew.<sup><a href="https://tldp.org/history.html">[1]</a></sup>
    </p>
	
	<p>
		Good, organized documentation is very important to the success of an
        open-source software project:
		It reduces the time required for users to orient themselves within 
        unfamiliar software.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="official-documentation" class="content">
	<h2> Official Documentation </h2>

	<p>
		Official documentation originates from the group or organization
		that is producing the work: It's part of the project itself.
		Official documentation is suitably positioned to be both exhaustive 
        and authoritative, and it should be maintained as rigorously as
        the project itself.
	</p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4 style="font-style: normal;">Pro Tip:</h4>
        <p>
            <em>Reconsider your sources.</em>
            Official documentation should should be your primary documentation.
        </p>
    </div>
    
	<p>
		Like the projects they are part of, official documentation is usually
		community-driven.
	</p>

	<p>
        Some good examples:
	</p>

	<ul class="big-list">
        <li>
            <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html">The Linux Manual Pages Project</a>: A collection of system reference manuals.
        </li>

       	<li>
			<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/"> The Linux Kernel Documentation</a>:
			A website documenting the latest Linux kernel.
		</li>
    
		<li>
			<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/"> Arch Linux's Wiki</a>:
			The official documentation of the Arch distribution is this wiki.
			It is an excellent resource; its material often applies to 
            distributions outside of Arch (for which it would be considered unofficial documentation).
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href="https://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html"> GNU's Official Docs</a>:
            These documents are available in multiple formats, including websites and downloadable pdf's.
			However, owing to their technical precision, this collection can be difficult to read.
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>


<div id="unofficial-documentation" class="content">
	<h2> Unofficial Documentation </h2>
	<p>
		Most documentation is from unofficial, secondary sources.
		Examples include this website, blogs, question/answer sites,
		Youtube videos, podcasts, books, etc..
		The best of these sources are those that originate
        from someone closely associated with the project.
	</p>

	<p>
		Examples of good, unofficial documentation:
	</p>

	<ul class="big-list">
      
        <li>
			<a href="http://www.kroah.com/lkn/"> Linux Kernel in a Nutshell</a>&mdash;
			A free book by Greg Kroah-Hartman.
			He says, "I want this book to help
			bring more people into the Linux kernel development fold.
			The act of building a customized kernel for your machine is one
			of the basic tasks needed to become a Linux kernel developer.
			The more people that try this out, and realize that there is
			not any real magic behind the whole Linux kernel process, the
			more people will be willing to jump in and help out in making
			the kernel the best that it can be."<sup><a href="http://www.kroah.com/lkn/">[2]</a></sup>
		</li>

        <li>
			<a href="https://debian-handbook.info/"> Debian Administrator's Handbook</a>&mdash;
			A free book written by RaphaÃ«l Hertzog and Roland Mas, two Debian developers.
			It was originally written in French, and has been translated into
			four other languages, with twenty(!) more translations in-progress.
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href="http://tldp.org/"> The Linux Documentation Project</a>&mdash;
			TLDP is not maintained anymore, so that its content is usually 
			out-of-date (but sometimes appropriate).
		</li>
				<li>
			<a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/"> Linux From Scratch </a>&mdash;
			From their website, "Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides
			you with step-by-step instructions for building your own customized
			Linux system entirely from source."<sup><a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/index.html">[3]</a></sup>
			Ya.
			It's a thing.
		</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="content" id="nf-books">
	<h2>Nonfree Books</h2>
	<p>
		In the main, I recommend staying away from non-free Linux books.
		There are several reasons for this.
	</p>

	<p>
		First, non-free books are almost always secondary sources, and hence,
		not authoritative.
		The books you want to read are by those people closest to
		the FOSS community, and they usually (but not always) write free books.
	</p>

	<p>
		Second, there's just too many of them, and very few are worthwhile.
		For instance, I bought a handbook on UNIX system administration
		that looked very promising, but taught me precious little.
		In fact, the free <a href="https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/">Debian Administrator's Handbook</a>
		proved a more succinct, and more authoritative, resource.
	</p>

	<p>
		Third, they tend to be out-of-date.
		For example, I really liked the premise of
		<a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Molay-Understanding-UNIX-LINUX-Programming-A-Guide-to-Theory-and-Practice/PGM190781.html">
			Understanding UNIX/LINUX Programming: A Guide to Theory and Practice
		</a>.
		It walks you through programming in Linux by recreating
		common command-line tools, such as <code>cat</code> and <code>ls</code>, but it
		was so out-of-date by the time I read it that the information in it couldn't be trusted.
		It'd be great to see this rewritten in a modern context.
	</p>

	<p>
	    The Exception:
	</p>

	<ul class="big-list">
		<li> <a href="https://www.man7.org/tlpi/index.html">The Linux Programming Interface</a>&mdash;
			This is the definitive text on the programming interface
			of the Linux kernel.
			Its writer, Michael Kerrisk, is the maintainer of the
			Linux Man Page project (above),
			and his work is simply terrific.
			If you want all the details of the system-call interface offered
			by the Linux kernel, as well as sound explanations of its
			internals, this is your book.
		</li>
	</ul>

    <p>
        This caution applies only to books about GNU/Linux itself:
        The best resources for computer science in general
        are usually nonfree.
