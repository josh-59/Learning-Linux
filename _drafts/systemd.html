systemd
<h4>What We Have and Why We Don't Like It</h4>

Bit of History:
    /sbin/init was, for many years, a network of shell scripts.

    "More than just a classic init system"

    So, provides system services similar to d-bus

    "covers a lot of ground" 
    "high level OS objects" --
        services users, sessions, containers, apps, ...
        vs. kernel "primitives", e.g., files, processes, sockets...
        sorta like "dynamic libraries"
    transparent, so that one can always figure out what's going on
    config files are human-readable
    the software will still boot (into defaults) if no config files are present

Extensive argument resulted in a fork from Debian, Devuan

arch linux wiki on systemd + "see this blog post"

Threatens to become an inalienable component of GNU/Linux platforms.

    A Red Hat employee working on PulseAudio, 
    "Since PulseAudio is a service I kept thinking about service management."

    "systemd's core business: service management"

    unifying "pointless difference between distributions", by providing the
    following three general functions:
    - A system and service manager (manages both the system, by applying various configurations, and its services)
    - A software platform (serves as a basis for developing other software)
    - The glue between applications and the kernel (provides various interfaces that expose functionalities provided by the kernel)

    An argument against it:
    "unifying pointless differences" is not the function of the init program,
    and violates the Unix philosophy of "do one thing and do it well."
    The nonmodularity of the result reduces the ability of individuals and
    organizations to iterate on the implementation.
