systemd


Bit of History:
    IN THE BEGGINING, 
    the shell operated as an obtuse loop, involving an <em>exec</em>
    call to itself.<sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup>

    /sbin/init was, for many years, a network of shell scripts.

    Extensive argument resulted in a fork from Debian, Devuan

What systemd did:
    Poettering pulled a great idea from Apple's <em>launchd,</em>
    which was to buffer interprocess communication, and thereby
    subvert process dependencies, so that all processes can 
    be launched in parallel.

Current Issue:
    The systemd ecosystem is so vast that it arguably constitutes a metadistribution.
    It includes a bootloader, 
    Moreover, if we take the logic of "unifying pointless differences" to its limit,
    we all might as well quit doing what we want and use Fedora instead, since
    there's no point in meaningless differences.


I propose <code>fbootd</code>, a modern init system with intentionally limited
and restricted scope: Get the system running, and act as a service manager only
insofar as single-user/desktop users require.
    First philosophy is concurrency
    Second philosophy is simplicity
        - Simplicity especially with respect to configuration architecture:
          A scheme users are intended to understand:
            + No meta-units called "targets"
, for the desktop/single-user environment.

    "More than just a classic init system"

    So, provides system services similar to d-bus

"covers a lot of ground" 
"high level OS objects" --
    services users, sessions, containers, apps, ...
    vs. kernel "primitives", e.g., files, processes, sockets...
    sorta like "dynamic libraries"
transparent, so that one can always figure out what's going on
config files are human-readable
the software will still boot (into defaults) if no config files are present

Lennart Poettering:
    https://thenewstack.io/unix-greatest-inspiration-behind-systemd/
    A Red Hat employee working on PulseAudio, 
    "Since PulseAudio is a service I kept thinking about service management."

    "systemd's core business: service management"

    unifying "pointless difference between distributions", by providing the
    following three general functions:
    - A system and service manager (manages both the system, by applying various configurations, and its services)
    - A software platform (serves as a basis for developing other software)
    - The glue between applications and the kernel (provides various interfaces that expose functionalities provided by the kernel)
    http://0pointer.de/public/gnomeasia2014.pdf

    An argument against it:
    "unifying pointless differences" is not the function of the init program,
    and violates the Unix philosophy of "do one thing and do it well."
    The nonmodularity of the result reduces the ability of individuals and
    organizations to iterate on the implementation.
