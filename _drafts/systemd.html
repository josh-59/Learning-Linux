systemd

    "More than just a classic init system"
    Is a SYSTEM manager 
        ...and a SERVICE manager


    So, provides system services similar to d-bus
    But, implies a monolithic (non-modular) system structure:
        Processes which take advantage of systemd's capabilities 
        become dependant upon it.
        (Potentially)
