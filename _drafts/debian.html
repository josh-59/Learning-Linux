    Debian:

    <p>
        In 1993, Ian Murdock grew frustrated with SLS Linux&mdash; 
        Not only was it a commercial venture, it was also, "...quite possibly the most bug-ridden and badly maintained Linux distribution available."<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
        That it was, additionally, the most popular distribution was, 
        "...a bad combination indeed."<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Ian envisioned a modular operating system, whose components could
        be maintained by people with appropriate specialities and desires.
        By making the project open, the burden of maintainership could be distributed.
        More, both the persistence of the project and the satisfaction of users' 
        requirements are assured.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        So Ian announced <a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "Debian Linux is a brand-new kind of Linux distribution. 
        Rather than being developed by one isolated individual or group, as other 
        distributions of Linux have been developed in the past, Debian is being 
        developed openly in the spirit of Linux and GNU. 
        The primary purpose of the Debian project is to finally create a distribution 
        that lives up to the Linux name. 
        Debian is being carefully and conscientiously put together and will be 
        maintained and supported with similar care. 
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Debian has become one of the most respected distributions of our time.
        It is oft-used as an upstream source for derivate distributions, and
        the quantity of software available through its repositories is unparalleled.
    </p>
 
UNIX: A Brief History:
Much better source:
Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday drafted the 
filesystem.<sup><a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050414215646742">[a]</a></sup>


    <p>
        About his colleague's early work, Dennis Ritchie would later remark,
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Thompson wanted to create a comfortable computing environment
        constructed according to his own design, using whatever means were
        available. His plans, it is evident in retrospect, incorporated many
        of the innovative aspects of Multics, including an explicit notion of
        a process as a locus of control, a tree-structured file system, a
        command interpreter as user-level program, simple representation of
        text files, and generalized access to devices.<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html">[4]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>


    <p>
        In 1993, Ian Murdock also grew frustrated with SLS Linux&mdash; its bugs, 
        closed development model and commercial nature.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
        Ian wanted an operating system that lived up to the <em>Linux</em> name,
        which was carefully and conscientiously assembled, and which was maintained
        with equal diligence.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
        In particular, he wanted a free operating system that could
        compete with commercial distributions.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Murdock envisioned a modular operating system, developed openly, 
        "... in the spirit of GNU and Linux,"
        which ensured the satisfaction of user requirements, and spread the
        burden of maintainership.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
        He named it <a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a>,
        a portmanteau of <em>Debra,</em> his wife, and <em>Ian,</em> himself.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/intro.en.html">[30]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        The project attracted developers, and today around
        a thousand people volunteer their spare time.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/intro/philosophy">[31]</a></sup>
        Debian is one of the most respected distributions of our time:
        The quantity of software available through its repositories is unparalleled,
        and it is oft-used as an upstream source for derivate distributions.
