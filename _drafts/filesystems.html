    <h2> Filesystems </h2>

    <p>
        A <em><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/File_Systems#File_System_Theory">filesystem</a></em>
        is a systematic method of storing and retrieving data on
        disk.<sup><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Filesystem">[9]</a><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/File_systems">[10]</a></sup>
        The first versions of UNIX referred to its own filesystem as, simply,
        <code>fs</code>.
        It was well-documented (by, for instance, Maurice J. Bach in
        <a href="https://archive.org/details/DesignUNIXOperatingSystem/mode/2up"><em>The Design of the Unix Operating System</em></a>), and became the basis of
        a sequence of filesystems, including Linux's <code>ext</code>
        and <code>ext2</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        These filesystems were relatively simple and naive:
        They expected that machines would always shutdown cleanly, and
        that hard-drives worked flawlessly.
        In particular, a power loss mid-write could leave the filesystem in
        an inconsistent state.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journaling_file_system">[11]</a></sup>
        Such a shutdown required a check of the entire structure.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journaling_file_system">[11]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        The issue of non-clean shutdowns was solved with the introduction of
        <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journaling_file_system">journaling</a>:</em>
        Before a change is made to the filesystem's contents, it is first written
        to an on-disk journal.
        Should the system shut down after the journal has been updated, the write
        can simply be resumed on reboot; should the system shut down before the 
        journal entry has been completed, the write is discarded.
        In either case, the consistency of the filesystem is preserved.
        Journaling filesystems are in wide use, and include Linux's excellent
        <a href="https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><code>ext4</code></a>
        and Microsoft's <code>NTFS</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next-generation filesystems are introducing myriad features to
        cope with hard-drive failures, especially, in enterprise settings.
        The most fundamental change is <em>copy on write,</em>
        a minor change in semantics which allows filesystem-wide snapshots to be
        created very efficiently, while reducing the need for journaling.
        Other features include native logical volume management (RAID support) and
        internal checksumming.

            <code>ZFS</code> has been described by Linus Torvalds as a "non-starter,"
            due to licensing issues.<sup><a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=189711&curpostid=189841">[17]</a></sup>

        Both <code><a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">btrfs</a></code>
        and <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a></code>
        are such next-generation filesystems.<sup><a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">[12]</a><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ZFS">[13]</a></sup>
        Of the two, <code>btrfs</code> has made inroads to becoming Linux's next
        major filesystem:
        It is in wide use by Facebook,<sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/824855/">[14]</a></sup> and is the
        the default filesystem for openSUSE and
        Fedora.<sup><a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:13.2/Features">[15]</a><a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-33/">[16]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Owing in part to a vast collection of open-source drivers,
        Linux can make use of many filesystems.
        The filesystems that the (running) kernel supports are listed at
        <code>/proc/filesystems</code>;
        formatting tools are generally of the form <code>mkfs.&lt;filesystem&gt;</code>;
        finally, <code>man</code> pages contain most relevant information.
    </p>

    <h3>Using a Filesystem</h3>

    <p>
        Creating a partitioning table and formatting the resulting
        partitions
        are the first steps to using a block device.
        This amounts to writing persistent data structures to the device,
        and is carried out in the Linux installation process before copying
        system files.
    </p>

    <p>
        The device in question is first partitioned by writing a
        partition table to it.
        The table is kept in the first blocks of the device,
        and segments the rest of the device's address space into distinct,
        non-overlapping <em>partitions.</em>
        This table is read by the kernel and, for each partition present,
        a new block special device file is presented in <code>/dev</code>.
    </p>

        <p>
            The partition format of our time is <code>GPT</code>.
            There are many options with respect to partitioning a disk.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Partitioning tools include <code>fdisk</code> and <code>parted</code>:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk1
    </div>

    <p>
        At this point, one may format a partition:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk1p1
    </div>

    <p>
        Each partition supports a distinct filesystem, and each filesystem has
        a unique root directory.
    </p>
