	<h1>Documentation</h1>

	<p>
        Documentation is like code: It must be written and
        maintained.
		Good, organized documentation is very important to the success of a
        software project:
		It reduces the time required for users to orient themselves within 
        unfamiliar software.

    <h4> What Every Superuser Should Know</h4>

    <p>
        A sound introduction to Linux system administration, written
            with the desktop user in mind, this is a great book.
            If you're looking for pearls of wisdom like, "Given the choice
            between modifying a file in <code>/usr</code> and <code>/etc</code>,
            always choose <code>/etc</code>," this is your book.

            The 3<sup>rd</code> edition was released April 2021, and
            its author is the

			The act of building a customized kernel for your machine is one
			of the basic tasks needed to become a Linux kernel developer.
			The more people that try this out, and realize that there is
			not any real magic behind the whole Linux kernel process, the

    <h2>Wikis</h2>

        Anyone is allowed to edit&mdash; this makes it very easy

    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">Arch Wiki</a>
        is, in my opinion, best viewed as a collection of 
        installation notes.  
        The user is expected to have considerable
        knowledge of a working GNU/Linux system; their 'hand'
        is not 'held'.

<div class="content" id="nf-books">
	<h2>Nonfree Books</h2>
	<p>
		In the main, I recommend staying away from non-free Linux books.
		There are several reasons for this.
	</p>

	<p>
		First, non-free books are almost always secondary sources, and hence,
		not authoritative.
		The books you want to read are by those people closest to
		the FOSS community, and they usually (but not always) write free books.
	</p>

	<p>
		Second, there's just too many of them, and very few are worthwhile.
		For instance, I bought a handbook on UNIX system administration
		that looked very promising, but taught me precious little.
		In fact, the free <a href="https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/">Debian Administrator's Handbook</a>
		proved a more succinct, and more authoritative, resource.
	</p>

	<p>
		Third, they tend to be out-of-date.
		For example, I really liked the premise of
		<a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Molay-Understanding-UNIX-LINUX-Programming-A-Guide-to-Theory-and-Practice/PGM190781.html">
			Understanding UNIX/LINUX Programming: A Guide to Theory and Practice
		</a>.
		It walks you through programming in Linux by recreating
		common command-line tools, such as <code>cat</code> and <code>ls</code>, but it
		was so out-of-date by the time I read it that the information in it couldn't be trusted.
		It'd be great to see this rewritten in a modern context.
	</p>

	<p>
	    Some Exceptions:
	</p>

	<ul class="big-list">
     
		<li> <a href="https://www.man7.org/tlpi/index.html">The Linux Programming Interface</a>&mdash;
			This is the definitive text on the programming interface
			of the Linux kernel.
			Its writer, Michael Kerrisk, is the maintainer of the
			Linux Man Page project (above), and his work is simply terrific.
			If you want all the details of the system-call interface offered
			by the Linux kernel, as well as sound explanations of its
			internals, this is your book.
		</li>
	</ul>

    <p>
        This caution applies only to books about GNU/Linux itself:
        The best resources for computer science in general
        are usually nonfree.

	<h2>Learning Linux</h2>

	<p>
		It's worthwhile, from time to time, to take a step back and reconsider
        the process of learning Linux itself.
	</p>

	<ol class="big-list" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
		<li>
			<i>What, exactly, is your question?</i>
			<p>
                Often, the hardest part is just figuring out what your question is.
				Try to be specific:
				In computers, things are <em>very</em> precisely defined.
			</p>
		</li>

        <li>
            <i>Be Patient.</i>
			<p>
                Skill accrues.
                Answer one question at a time.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<i>Reconsider your sources.</i>
            <p>
                Does it make sense that this person would write about the
                subject at hand?
                What relationship do they have to the project?
                How authoritative are they?
