        In 1973, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie published the first
        paper about their work, 
        <em>The Unix Time-Sharing System.</em>
        Owing to anti-monopoly legislation, AT&amp;T was forbidden
        from profitting from the software, and Unix was not made
        available as a product <em>per se;</em>
        from 1973 to 1984, the latest version of Unix, including source,
        was available for a $150 administrative fee.

        The work was of interest, especially, to academics, 
        who, for the first time, could afford to purchase a 
        computer&mdash; by department.
        The license it was distributed under permitted free use
        within an organization, "provided the users do not disclose
        outside the organization."<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/licenses.html">[a]</a></sup>
        It was taught by professors and studied by college students
        as both a functional tool and an exemplar operating system.

        In 1975 Ken Thompson took a sabatical from Bell Laboraties to
        teach at the University of California Berkley.
        His first task, of course, was installing Unix on 
        their  PDP-Something Something.
        Ken Thompson taught for two years,
        sufficient time to get a fork of UNIX off the ground.
        Known as the <em>Berkley Software Distribution,</em>
        it began at Unix source and diverged upon the
        efforts of professors and students alike.

        Improvements were welcome from any source, and the BSD
        project marked the first time that software creation
        was open and distributed.
        Over traditional Unix, BSD boasted networking capabilities,
        a faster filesystem, better virtual memory handling,
        and support for a larger variety of programming languages.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">[b]</a></sup>

    <h3>Unix Wars</h3>

    <p>
        College students graduate, and BSD marked the first of many 
        independently developed <em>Unix</em> clones. 
        A number of proprietary variants were developed and sold,
        including DEC's Ultrix, SunOS, Microsoft's Xenix,
