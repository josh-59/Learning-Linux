Introduction:

The C Programming Language was introduced in 1971
as a response to a lack of programmer-centric languages.
It was the first programmers' language.

History:
    Bell Labs(!)
        Programming projects in Fortran was fun in much the same way
        three-legged races are fun. 
            - Ken Thompson, in Reflections on Trusting Trust

    """
        <blockquote>
BCPL, B, and C all fit firmly in the traditional procedural family typified 
by Fortran and Algol 60. They are particularly oriented towards system 
programming, are small and compactly described, and are amenable to translation 
by simple compilers. They are `close to the machine' in that the abstractions 
they introduce are readily grounded in the concrete data types and operations 
supplied by conventional computers, and they rely on library routines for 
input-output and other interactions with an operating system. With less 
success, they also use library procedures to specify interesting control 
constructs such as coroutines and procedure closures. At the same time, their 
abstractions lie at a sufficiently high level that, with care, portability 
between machines can be achieved. 
        </blockquote>

The importance of K&amp;R:
        Has been <a href="http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/belllabs-microsite-dritchie/cbook/index.html">translated many times</a>,
        and has been imitated several times:
            The Go Programming language, by so-and-so
            The Rust Programming Language, by such-and-such

As for the language, many have tried to improve it by augmenting its spartan
nature, and none have succeeded.

        This is the big hurdlle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the
        program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and
        find out where your output went.  With these mechanical details mastered,
        everything else is comparatively easy.

        The first hurdle in programming is setting up your compilation tools,
        and asserting that they 
        work.<sup><a href="#references" title="pp 5-6">[1]</a></sup>

<div class="content" id="memory">
    <h2>Memory!</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Fun Fact:</h4>
        <p>
            One Russian machine was designed around a 'bit' that had three
            possible states.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Modern hardware (uniformly) addresses memory in the unit of the byte:
        A memory location is referred to by a number, called its <em>address,</em>
        and this number refers to exactly one byte of memory.
        A byte is composed of 8 bits, with each bit having a state of either 
        <code>1</code> or <code>0</code> 
        (or <em>on</em> or <em>off;</em> 
        or <em>true</em> or <em>false;</em>
        etc., depending on your mindset). 
        This wasn't always the case: 
        these were referred to as <em>words,</em>
        but since c. 1970's, the 8-bit "byte" has been universally adopted as standard.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
                The reason ASCII is antiquated is that 256 (2^8) 
                characters is insufficient for international use.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        No metadata is stored alongside this unit of memory, and, each byte may be
        interpretted in a variety of ways. 
        Most interpretations reflect numbers, which, without getting into
        specifics, allow bytes to hold large positive integers,
        positive or negative integers, or decimal approximations of rational numbers,
        called <em>floating point numbers.</em>
        For the purposes of lightening your wallet, these interpretation, 
        and elementary operations on them, are supported by hardware natively.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since the interpretation of a byte is not stored by the machine natively, 
        it is the programmer's job to keep their interpretations consistent; 
        this is aided by a programming language.
        A <em>high level</em> programming language simplifies writing
        programs by automating the interpretation of statements.
        Formally, the compiler <em>maps</em> high-level statements onto 
        machine-readable instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
        All high-level languages, including C, present the programmer with
        so-called <em>primitive</em> types, reflective of the above basic 
        interpretations.
    </p>

    <p>
        The attentive reader might have noticed that the byte has 2^8 = 256 possible
        states.  
        256 is not a very large number, and, if a machine had more than 
        256 bytes of memory, it would not even be able to address its own memory!
        So bytes are grouped together, typically in powers of two:
        1 byte, 2 bytes, 4 bytes, 8 bytes, ect..
        4 bytes leaves us with 32 bits, or, 2^32 = 4,292,967,296 possible states,
        a much more satisfying number.  
        More, if the machine addresses its own memory with a 32-bit number, then
        it is capable of addressing 2^32 unique bytes 
        (precisely 4 gibibytes, just over four gigabytes).
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Early Cray Supercomputers used 24-bit memory addresses.
        </p>
    </div>

<h3> Pointers </h3>

    <p>
        A <em>pointer</em> is a memory location that holds an address.
        In C, a pointer may point to an integer, a character, or any other
        <em>typed</em> memory location.
        Accessing that memory is called <em>dereferencing</em> the pointer;
        naturally, many pointers may refer to the same location in memory.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pointers, and in turn explicit memory management, 
        are the central features of the C programming language.
        Maniuplating memory is at the very core of what programming
        is, and even in other languages, it is usually necessary to
        understand how the language is doing what it's doing.
        For its literal interpretation of memory, C 
        has been called "Portable Assembly." 
    </p>

    <h2>Derived Types</h2>

    <p>
        Primitive types may be numerous, but they are finite:
        Ultimately, they are defined by the machine.
        To remedy the situation, we introduce <em>derived</em> types,
        which are just ordered collections of primitives.
    </p>

    <p>
        The most common derived type is the array:
    </p>

    <pre>
        int arr[10];
    </pre>

    <p>
        Allocates space enough for ten <em>int</em>'s, and stores a pointer
        to it in <em>arr</em>.
        In C, an <em>int</em> is 32 bytes and signed, so, we have just
        allocated 320 bytes to store 10 positive or negative numbers.
        Dereferencing <em>arr</em> is simple enough:
        <code>arr[0]</code> is the first element,
        <code>arr[1]</code> is the second,
        and so on until <code>arr[9]</code>, the final element.
    </p>

    <p>
        An array may be made of any length, holding any given type.
    </p>

    <p>

<div class="content" id="thread-stack-model">
    <h2>Thread/Stack Model of Execution</h2>

    <p>
        The thread of execution may contain branches, loops and other
        so-called <em>flow-control</em> constructs.
        In the case of branches, the thread of execution follows exactly one path
        at a time;
        a loop may repeat, conceptually, forever.
    </p>

</div>


<div class="content" id="functions">
    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <pre>

          Main
            |   fn
            |   /|
            |  / |
            | /  |
            |/   |
            |
            |\   |
            | \  |
            |  \ |
            |   \|
            |
    </pre>

    <p>
        The first reason to create a function is that the code in the function
        is very common, and it would be silly to repeat it.
        This is the case with the standard library functions, like
        <code>printf</code> and malloc.
        Doing so saves programmer time, reduces mistakes, and reduces the burdern
        of maintainership.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second reason is more subtle: <em>main</em> became too
        complicated. 
        To reduce a function's apparent complexity, 
        we introduce so-called <em>helper functions</em>.
        These functions might do something as minor as assert if a
        condition is true, and their use is highly recommended.
    </p>

    <p>
        In either case, the programmer is presented with an abstraction of
        some computer behavior.

    <code>autoconf</code> tool chain."

    In an ironic response, it took one lady four years to learn 
    how <em>autoconf</em> worked.
