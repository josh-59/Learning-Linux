        Main idea: C is "first programmer's language"

        Programming projects in Fortran was fun in much the same way
        three-legged races are fun. 
            - Ken Thompson, in Reflections on Trusting Trust

    """
BCPL, B, and C all fit firmly in the traditional procedural family typified 
by Fortran and Algol 60. They are particularly oriented towards system 
programming, are small and compactly described, and are amenable to translation 
by simple compilers. They are `close to the machine' in that the abstractions 
they introduce are readily grounded in the concrete data types and operations 
supplied by conventional computers, and they rely on library routines for 
input-output and other interactions with an operating system. With less 
success, they also use library procedures to specify interesting control 
constructs such as coroutines and procedure closures. At the same time, their 
abstractions lie at a sufficiently high level that, with care, portability 
between machines can be achieved.

    "There are perhaps 30 developers worldwide who understand the
    <code>autoconf</code> tool chain."

    In an ironic response, it took one lady four years to learn 
    what <em>autoconf</em> did.

    "The primary goal of Autoconf is making the <em>user's</em>[sic] life easier;
    making the <em>maintainer's</em>[sic] life easier is only a secondary goal.

        Includes its own build system

        Forward-looking?
        Aside:
            I've been looking for a reason to buy 96GiB RAM...

        Tightly coupled dependencies:
            There is, finally, one good <em>regex</em> implementation.



Hello World:
    The first step in programming is setting up your compilation tools,
    and making sure they work.

Memory!:
    Bytes, Zero, Nonzeros
    Interpretting memory
        Integers, Floating Points, Characters

Derived Types:
    Arrays, Structs

Control Statements:
    Conditionals
    Loops

Functions:
    Do_something

Shit Happens:
    - Bugs happen (even at the hardware level)
    - Some statistics on bugs

Closing Remarks:
    The importance of K&amp;R:
        I struggled even to <em>outline</em> this chapter.
        All C documentation exists in the shadow of that work
        And it has been imitated several times:
            The Go Programming language, by so-and-so
            The Rust Programming Language, by such-and-such
