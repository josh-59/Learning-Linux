title: How Open Source Works
last-updated: May 2021
---

<!--

    Maybe tone this back to the slightly more (user) approachable
    "What is Open Souce?"
    I mean, the average user is not expected to contribute, and therefore
    "how it works" is somewhat outside the scope of this work...

        Derivate works are common, as well:
        <a href="https://librewolf-community.gitlab.io/">LibreWolf</a>
        is a derivate of Mozilla Firefox focused on privacy, security and
        freedom.

    <p>
        So what makes it all tick?
        In this dramatic conclusion, we'll pick apart the
        key components of the open-source ecosystem,
        from the motivations of contributors to the leadership
        style necessarily implied by them.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="ownership">
    <h2>Ownership in Open-Source</h2>

    Since source code is available whenever the runnable program
    is available, and any user may redistribute the product, there
    is no difference between "distributing" a piece of free software
    and "releasing" it.

    <p>
        Open-source licenses have called into question the notion
        of ownership, with at least one economist arguing that 
        ownership in open-source is defined in terms of the right
        to distribute, as opposed to the more traditional 
        right-to-exclude.
        His perspective is that since open-source software must
        be redistributable by any user, it is not the case that
        any individual or organization "owns" the code, in the sense
        that they can stipulate what may or may not be done with it.
    </p>

    <p>
        I personally don't hold with this notion: I find it
        too far removed from our usual interpretation of <em>ownership,</em>
        and prefer instead to identify what <em>is</em> owned in
        open-source.
    </p>

    <p>
        Repository maintainer decides what goes into 
        his (her) repository.
        And, when (if) to release it.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            The term <em>maintainer</em> is often used to refer to
            the position of project leader.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        So, while users are in theory
        empowered to shape a project into what they want, 
        in practice these modifications are moderated by the project's
        maintainers.
        In this way, entities within the open-source ecosystem
        retain definition, and the community does not
        devolve into an equal-merit free-for-all.
    </p>

    <p>
        Given significant difference of opinion, an individual or group
        can always fork the source repository and 
        lead a sister project in their preferred direction.
        For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection#EGCS_fork">Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System</a> was a fork
        of GNU's compiler collection that included new languages 
        in a manner more free-wheeling than the FSF 
        found acceptable.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a nontrivial sense, the ability to choose and curate
        is the backbone of open-source, and takes place on
        multiple levels. 
        A distribution implicitly curates
        projects in their presentation of an operating system, while
        users curate distributions, projects and source, 
        however they see fit.

<div class="content" id="motivations">
    <h2>Motivations</h2>
    // The result is chaotic, in much the same way the free
    // market is chaotic.
    // The difference is currency.
        A reasonable question to ask, is, <em>Why?</em>
        as in, <em>Why take seriously and labor for something
        without obvious monetary reward?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Economist Steven Weber offers some insight:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "Human beings often have a passionate relationship to their
        creative endeavors and their work; they wish to share
        their creativity with others; and value inheres in
        things other than monetizable rewards.  Each of these
        attitudes exists within the open source community."<sup><a href="#references" title="Weber p10">[g]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Another way of saying this is that 
        <em>Those who do the work get to make the decisions.</em>
        Thus, the open-source community supports those projects
        that are most important to them.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an example, the <em>util-linux</em> package was originally
        forked from the BSD project, and passed through
        several maintainers between versions 2.2 and 2.12.<sup><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git/refs/tags">[g]</a></sup>
        When it became clear that the project had been abandoned, it was
        <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/18/19">picked up again</a>
        by Karel Zak, whom continues to maintain it today.
        In this way, those projects which are of interest to the community
        are maintained, while those that are not are eventually dropped.
    </p>

    <p>
        Compared to the market economy we all know and love, 
        open source a strange beast:
        Its works are carried out because what they 
        are <em>is</em> what their creators want.

<div class="content" id="projects">
    // It is not the case that GNU has created the de-facto
    // open-source operating system.
    // What has proved to work has 
    // *decomposed* into a puzzle of some roughly 500 pieces.

    <p>
        The open-source ecosystem has decomposed into
        projects, with people working on what they want.
        While we may wish to think that each project is a paradigm
        of virtue and cooperation, this is in fact not the case.
        Public desire is often not homogenous, and the role of project leader 
        can quickly skew from 
        <em>lead developer</em> to <em>modification curator.</em>

    <h4>A Success Story</h4>

    <p>
        A <em>paging utility</em> is a program that displays a file on 
        the terminal one screenful at a time.
        The first widely used paging utility was <code>more</code>, written by
        Dan Halbert as a graduate student at UC Berkley in 1978.<sup><a href="https://danhalbert.org/more.html">[aa]</a></sup>
        <code>more</code> is a simple program: It first 
        fills up the screen, then waits for user input to print the 
        next line(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1983, Mark Nudelman was a software developer working for a
        company called Integrated Office Systems. From the <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#history"><code>less</code> FAQ</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Some of our software ran on a Unix system and produced enormous log files
        of its transactions. We wanted to be able to search these log files for
        error messages. But the version of "vi" we were using couldn't handle
        files larger than a certain size, and our log files often exceeded that
        size. So we were forced to use "more" to view the files. The problem was,
        once we found an error message, what we really wanted to see was the
        transactions leading up to the error; that is, the lines in the log file
        immediately before the error message. But more didn't allow backward
        movement in the file.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        We often complained about this problem. We said we needed a "backwards
        more"; someone (it wasn't me, but unfortunately I don't remember who
        it was) coined the name "less" as a joke on the concept of a "backwards
        more". It didn't seem to me that it would be too difficult to write a
        simple pager that would allow forward and backward movement.
        I wrote the first version in late 1983 and we began using it internally.
        I continued to enhance it and finally decided it was a useful enough
        tool that I should make it available to the world. I posted the first
        version to the newsgroup called (at that time) net.sources in May, 1985.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Making the program publicly available allowed an enormous number of
        people to use it. Many people have made their own modifications and
        donated them to me for incorporation into the official version, and
        many more have reported bugs they've found or made suggestions about
        features they'd like to see added. This was my first experience with
        the concept of what is now called "open source" or "free software",
        and it has, I believe, produced a very high quality product. I'd like
        to thank all the users of less for their invaluable comments and
        suggestions over the years. 
        Less wouldn't be what it is today without you.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Mark Nudelman continues to maintain the project today.  
        It is, at the time of this writing, in its 581<sup>st</sup> 
        version.<sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#version">[q]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/index.html">[r]</a></sup>

        To me, the magic of open-source is that it's composed of works

        Most people can make a program work&mdash; and programming is 
        a great hobby and a useful skill&mdash;
        but software that is widely used is extremely sophisticated.
        The works we use every day are shepherded by talented and educated
        individuals, whom are professionals of their field.

        pieces of wood nailed together—inexpertly—is fairly small outside 
        of the "proud grandfather" segment, and getting from there to a
