            Licenses that do not perpetuate themselves are known as

        Software differs from material objects in
        that it can be copied cheaply and 
        easily.https://gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html
        Because it can be distributed cheaply, free software is like math 
        or science: It belongs to everyone, and to no one; and, its
        results are tangible, immediate, tractable.

        The people who take such subjects further do so principally because
        they find them interesting.
        For them, the open-source domain naturally beckons.
        This, in a nutshell, is the story of Linus Torvalds: His kernel 
        grew out of a multithreaded terminal emulator project intended to 
        explore the capabilities of his new 386 CPU, and his career was
        defined by the pursuit of interesting.

        I think it's great:
            Professional-class software is fascinating.  
            More, it has interesting properties:
                It persists, and improves over time; it seems <em>worth</em> studying
        
        Most popular license is MIT's (permissive) license.
        Most people who contribute to open-source do so just as a hobby;
        they differ from Stallman in that they are not concerned
        with where the code ends up.

associated with 'free software' in the past and sell the idea strictly on
the same pragmatic, business-case grounds that motivated Netscape"

        An operating system is a collection of software which facilitates
        the use of a computer.
        To this end, its two main responsibilities are to support running
        programs, callled processes, and to maintain persistent
        data, in the form of files.
        In addition, operating systems ease the task of creating
        useful programs by offering programmers a logical architecture
        and predictable environment.
        GNU/Linux has evolved to offer the single best 
        programming environment available today.

    <h2>UNIX</h2>
    <p>
        The Unix Operating System was born in late 1969 at Bell Labs, in the shadow
        of <a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">Multics</a>.
        Multics was an operating system intended to
        commercialize computing by offering it as a service, similar to telephone or
        electricity.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">[1]</a></sup>
        The intent was for users to connect <a href="terminals-and-shells.html">terminals</a>
        to a central mainframe, then pay for computation on an as-used basis.
    </p>

    <p>
        Being a joint venture between MIT, AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories, and General
        Electric, Multics was a large and, in many ways, novel, project.
        It introduced many new operating systems ideas&mdash; among them,
        the hierarchical
        file structure.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">[1]</a></sup>
        For a variety of reasons, the project never realized its dream, and in 1969
        Bell Laboratories abandoned it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within Bell Labs, management put operating systems research on
        the backburner, and refused to purchase new computing
        equipment.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#references">[3]</a></sup>
        After finding a disused <a href="https://www.soemtron.org/pdp7.html">PDP-7</a>,
        Ken Thompson rewrote <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Travel_(video_game)">Space Travel</a></em> for
        it.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#references">[3]</a></sup>
        In the process, he accrued the tools and skills necessary to implement
        a filesystem he and others at Bell Laboratories had been devising on paper.<sup><a href="#references">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        At some point in 1969, while working on his filesystem, Ken Thompson realized that he was three weeks
        from an operating system.  All he needed was an
        <em>exec</em> call, an assembler, a text editor and a shell.
        In 1970, the new operating system was christened <em>UNIX,</em>
        as a "somewhat treacherous pun on
        MULTICS."<sup><a href="#references">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Owing in part to the restrictive nature of available
        hardware, the budding operating system focused
        on simplicity.<sup><a href="#references">[4]</a></sup>
        The earliest versions of the new operating system were put to use
        internally by Bell Labs to assist in patent
        applications.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#references">[3]</a></sup>
        The software then moved away from its nest under obtuse licenses to
        universities, where its source code, though not free, was studied and documented.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
        Finally, Unix became commercially available, to principally
        corporate clients.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>

    <h2>The Unix Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        Unix had a clear, simple, and well-documented architecture
        that
        <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Unix_history-simple.svg">inspired many operating systems</a>, including GNU/Linux.
        It is organized as a heirarchy of layers:
        Each layer builds upon the one beneathe it, and supports
        the layer immediately above it.
    </p>

    <img src="assets/img/linux-architecture.png" style="height: 400px;">

    <p>
        <strong>Hardware:</strong>
        At the heart of any computer is its hardware.
        Each piece of hardware has a software interface defined by the
        engineering team that created it.
        These interfaces are varied at best.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Drivers:</strong>
        Drivers interact with hardware, and provide the kernel with
        a more-uniform interface to each piece.
        This software layer
        represents the deepest and most remote element of any operating system.
        Although drivers can be installed on an as-needed basis, in GNU/Linux
        the tendency is to include many drivers, and use only those that are required.
        Drivers are not usually written by the hardware's engineers or vendors.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Kernel:</strong>
        While the heart of any computer is its hardware, the heart any
        Unix-like operating system is its kernel.
        The kernel is responsible for 
        supporting running programs,
        scheduling the CPU, allotting memory,
        and maintaining file integrity.
        It is a large and involved piece of software, and can be likened
        to the "brains" of the operating system.
        In Unix-like operating systems, it is not possible to interact directly
        with the kernel.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>System Calls:</strong>
        The operations that the kernel can undertake are 
        defined by the system calls it supports.
        Unix-like operating systems have six essential system calls:
        <em>fork, exec, open, close, read,</em> and
        <em>write.</em><sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
        Both <em>fork</em> and <em>exec</em> are concerned with launching
        programs, while <em>open, close, read,</em> and <em>write</em> 
        constitute the essential operations of interaction with files.
        Processes cannot dictate how the kernel carries system calls out,
        and in fact, the kernel may deny a system call if, say, a file does not
        exist, or the calling process does not have appropriate authority.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Processes:</strong>
        A process, sometimes called a "user-space process" or "user-land process,"
        is an executing program.
        Within Unix and other Unix-like operating systems, processes run the entire show:
        The kernel is entirely dependant upon processes
        to tell it what to do.
        It follows that there must exist at least one "trusted" process within
        user-land, to get other processes on their feet&mdash;
        and this is exactly the case.
        This is one of the more beautiful elements of the
        Unix architecture.

        <center>Richard Stallman</center>
    </div>

    <p>
        The first attempt at producing a deliberately free and open-source 
        Unix clone was
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.en.html#f1">announced</a> by Richard Stallman in 1983.
        Stallman had been working at MIT's AI Laboratory for over a decade,
        and had grown accustomed to its culture of sharing source code:
        "If you saw someone using an unfamiliar and interesting program, you
        could always ask to see the source code, so that you could read it, change
        it, or cannibalize parts of it to make a new 
        program."<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">[6]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1981, that culture collapsed as 
        commercial ventures hired away most of the
        lab.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">[6]</a><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch07.html">[7]</a></sup>
        In 1982, when administrators purchased a new PDP-10, they opted for a 
        closed-source, proprietary operating system, and indirectly threatened
        to seal the fate of software freedom.
        Stallman began to consider the merits of sharing software in 
        itself,
        in the process deriving an analogy to scientific cooperation, a pillar of
        the University's  morals.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-programs-should-be-shared.html">[8]</a><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/yes-give-it-away.html">[9]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet, proprietary software was becoming the norm, with students working
        on projects intended for profit<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-programs-should-be-shared.html">[8]</a></sup>
        and companies going so far as to require  
        nondisclosure agreements be signed to get an 
        executable.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">[6]</a></sup>
        On September 27, 1983, Stallman announced his resolution:
        To produce a "complete Unix-compatible software system," and to 
        "give it away free."<a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.en.html#f1"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
        He called the project <a href="https://gnu.org">GNU</a>, a recursive 
        acronym for 
        <em>GNU's Not Unix.</em><sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html">[11]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
        These ideas are expressed formally and generally through <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft</a>.</em><sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">[6]</a></sup>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        At the time of announcement, Stallman had not yet quantified his 
        own intentions behind the word <em>free.</em>
        Certainly, "a free copy" did not embody the 
        culture of code-sharing MIT was once home to.
        More, he could not put the code in the public domain because 
        modified versions of it it could become proprietary.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft#History">[12]</a></sup>
        By 1985, Stallman had sorted these issues out: 
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
            GNU is not in the public domain. Everyone will be permitted to 
            modify and redistribute GNU, but no distributor will be allowed to 
            restrict its further redistribution. That is to say, proprietary 
            modifications will not be allowed. I want to make sure that all 
            versions of GNU remain free.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">[13]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

           
    <p>
        Thus, software freedom became <em>users'</em> freedoms: 
        Users can run, study, modify, copy and distribute the software;
        but, if they distribute, then those freedoms must be preserved.  
        Software freedom was implemented in different forms in the various 
        licenses of early GNU products; in 1989, parts of these licenses were taken 
        together to form the GNU 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#History">General Public License</a>, 
        version 1.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#History">[14]</a></sup>

        About it, Linus Torvalds writes:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "Under the terms of the GPL, money is not the issue.
        You can charge a million bucks if someone is willing to pay
        for it, but you have to make sources available.  
        And the person you give or sell the source to has to have
        all the rights you have. 
        It's a brilliant device."<sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>

    <h2>The Linux Kernel </h2>

    <p>
        On August 25, 1991, a Finnish graduate student by the name of Linus Torvalds
        announced his own free operating system project.
        Again following the architecture of the Unix operating system,
        his project was intended to be "...just a hobby, won't be big and
        professional like GNU."<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[16]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right" style="font-size: 11pt;">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Properly speaking, the name <em>Linux</em> refers only to the Linux kernel.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        While the GNU Project sought to
        produce an entire operating system, Linus restricted his
        attention to creating a kernel.
        By October of 1991, GNU's Bash, GCC, Make and other
        programs were running on his creation.<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[16]</a></sup>
        He soon released it under the GNU General Public License, Version 2.
        Later, he would write:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
        "The fact is, to make Linux usable, I had relied on a lot of tools that had
        been distributed freely over the Internet&mdash;I had hoisted myself up
        on the shoulders of giants.  The most important of these free software
        programs was the GCC compiler."<sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Linus Torvalds became interested in operating systems after
            finding an error in the source code of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL">Sinclair QL's</a> QDOS.
            <sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
            In college, Andrew Tanenbaum's
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_Systems:_Design_and_Implementation"><em>Operating Systems: Design and Implementation</em></a>
            took this interest to new heights.<sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Interest in the kernel flourished, in large part because
        of the informality of the project:
        <a href="pre/free-minix-like-kernel-sources-for-386-at.html">Everybody was invited,</a> if only
        to tinker.
        This development model&mdash; "release early and often, delegate everything you can,
        be open to the point of promiscuity"<sup><a href="#references">[17]</a></sup>&mdash; <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html#catbmain">raised eyebrows</a> at the time,
        but has proven sound in virtue of its overwhelming success:
        The Linux kernel has become the most-used Unix-like kernel of all time.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/2.Process.html?highlight=merge window">kernel development process</a>
        has become more structured since 1991, and today uses a
        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/programming-in-nix.html#train-schedules">train-schedule</a> approach.
        Linus Torvalds remains the maintainer of the Development branch,
        and often remarks upon the kernel's latest releases.

    <p>
        A major figure of today's Linux development team is Greg Kroah-Hartman 
        (pronounced "<em>Crow</em>-Hartman"), who maintains the Stable branch, 
        in addition to various subsystems.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kroah-Hartman">[18]</a></sup>
        According to Mr. Kroah-Hartman, interest in the kernel continues to
        grow, with 1200 new developers contributing each
        year.<sup><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/26/linux_kernel_intel/">[19]</a></sup>
        Their main development bottlenecks are code review and
        maintainership.<sup><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/26/linux_kernel_intel/">[19]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Although the Linux kernel began as a hobby, it is an occupation
        for some, and serious affair for many.
        In particular, the kernel development team
        takes great care not to break
        user-space,<sup><a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75">[20]</a></sup>
        meaning that programs that <em>did</em> work will continue to
        work.
        In this way, they ensure the long-term stability of Linux-based
        systems.<sup><a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/235335/why-is-there-a-linux-kernel-policy-to-never-break-user-space">[21]</a></sup>

    <h2> Linux Distributions: A Brief History </h2>

    <p>
        The first versions of the Linux kernel were available 
        only in source-code form, and required compilation on a 
        host machine.<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[16]</a></sup> 
        More, no other software was included, so that the 
        creation of a Linux-based machine required obtaining, compiling and
        assembling a number of software components by the user.

        <center style="font-size: 12pt;">HJ Lu's Boot/Root Floppies</center>
    </div>

    <p>
        In 1992, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HJ_Lu">HJ Lu</a>
        began packaging utilities alongside the kernel and distributing the
        collection together on a pair of 5.25" disks.<sup><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/history-of-early-linux-distros/">[22]</a><a href="https://itsfoss.com/earliest-linux-distros/">[23]</a></sup>
        Known as <em>boot/root</em> floppies, they are
        the first known Linux distribution,<sup><a href="https://itsfoss.com/earliest-linux-distros/">[23]</a></sup>
        and worked similarly to a live CD:
        You booted from one disk, then replaced it when prompted.
        "After a while," says Joe Klemmer, "you got a command prompt."<sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/">[24]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Linux's first widely recognized and used distribution was, ironically, 
        a commercial venture: Soft Landing System.<sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/">[24]</a></sup>
        Released in late 1992, SLS was sold under the slogan "Gentle Touchdowns for DOS Bailouts",<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System">[25]</a></sup>
        but users complained that the software was buggy,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System">[25]</a><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[26]</a></sup> and when its developers
        decided to change the executable file format, began to leave.<sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/">[14]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h3> Two Approaches </h3>

    <p>
        In late 1992, Patrick Volkerding needed a LISP interpreter for a project
        at school, and, having heard that <code>clisp</code> ran on SLS Linux, 
        downloaded them both.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[26]</a></sup>
        His professor got wind, and asked Patrick to help him install the software
        on school computers.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[26]</a></sup>

        Volkerding walked him through installing, fixing and patching SLS, and
        afterward, his professor asked, "Is there some way we can fix the install disks so
        that the new machines will have these fixes right away?"<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[26]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        So Volkerding began improving SLS, and internally named his project
        <em>Slackware;</em> he didn't want the project taken too seriously.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[26]</a></sup>
        By May, though, the improvements were becoming substantial, and when
        first released on the internet in June, proved so popular that the 
        number of download requests crashed the system hosting it.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[26]</a></sup>
        Volkerding hadn't intended to produce a distribution,<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[26]</a></sup> but still
        maintains <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> today.<sup><a href="http://www.slackware.com/about">[27]</a></sup>
        The Slackware Linux Project is aimed at producing, "the most UNIX-like
        Linux distribution out there."<sup><a href="http://www.slackware.com/info/">[28]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1993, Ian Murdock also grew frustrated with SLS Linux,<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
        and, more, sought a better solution to distribution creation than 
        single-person or closed-room schemes.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
        Ian wanted an operating system that lived up to the Linux name, 
        was carefully and conscientiously assembled, and which was maintained
        with equal diligence.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
        In particular, he wanted a free operating system that could
        compete with commercial distributions.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Murdock decided to make the process open, in the spirit of GNU and Linux,
        thereby ensuring satisfaction of user's requirements while also 
        unloading the burden of creation and maintainership.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
        He named it <a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, 
        a portmanteau of <em>Debra,</em> his wife, and <em>Ian,</em> himself.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/intro.en.html">[30]</a></sup>
        The project's openness attracted developers, and today around 
        a thousand people volunteer their spare time.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/intro/philosophy">[31]</a></sup>
        Debian is one of the most respected distributions of our time,
        and is oft-used as an upstream source for other distributions.

        With the internet came 
        <a href="https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major">many</a>
        Linux distributions.
        I think of them as flavors of the same thing, rather than
        necessarily different.
        Since they are each based around the Linux kernel, and the kernel
        has the property that it does not change behavior across versions,
        they are all fundamentally similar operating systems.

    <h2> Linux Mint </h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Mint is downstream of Debian and Ubuntu.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        I like
        <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint,</a>
        but then, I'm a simple guy.
        Mint is a characteristically professional operating system,
        and focuses on productivity&mdash; that means you'll be up and
        running before you know it.
        It is extremely new-user friendly, and maintains the power
        of any other Unix-like operating system.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mint offers the Cinnamon desktop environment;
        Windows users will feel right at home.
        I find it to be an attractive desktop, but it's only moderately customizable.
        Like many users, I just want a desktop environment that stays out of my way,
        and Cinnamon does exactly that.

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            It has been said that one can spend a lifetime customizing
            Linux desktops.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
        New for Mint 19 is <em>Timeshift.</em> From <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift">their github:</a>
        "Timeshift protects your system by taking incremental
        snapshots of the file system at regular intervals. These snapshots
        can be restored at a later date to undo all changes to the system."
    </p>



    <p>
        Mint isn't perfect:  It tends to be boring.
        Changes from release to release are minor, and the software available from 
        Debian's
        repositories tends to be mature and stable, as opposed to new and unproven.
