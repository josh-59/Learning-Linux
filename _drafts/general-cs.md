## Programming Languages
    Programming languages you must know
    Python
    C

## Data Structures
After learning a programming language or two,
data structures are the next thing to learn in becoming 
a developer.
some understanding of discrete math is a required.
To illustrate, the typical methodology in writing a program is to
<em>first select the most appropriate data structure,</em>
then build the rest of the program around it.

Open Data Structures 
is a great book on the subject, the best that I
personally have found.
Advanced studies delve further into mathematics, usually focusing on analysis of 
algorithms.
The canonical text of algorithms is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition">Introduction to Algorithms</a>.

## Operating Systems
A very large topic, it
discusses operating systems in the abstract.  
A good, if lighthearted, development is given by 
Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau in
their free <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/"> Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces</a>.
                
## Computer Architecture
Ah, computer architecture.  I loved studying this subject,
but honestly wonder how useful it is.  
It looks into the abstractions presented by
hardware itself, such as signed and unsigned numbers, 
and instruction set architectures.
A good development of this
material is highly mathematical.
I liked <a href="http://www.csapp.cs.cmu.edu/">Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective</a>.

## Discrete Mathematics
At the end of abstraction, there is always math, it seems.
Discrete mathematics is not a difficult subject,
on par with a first semester in calculus.  
It will introduce enough logic to give informal proofs, 
cover graphs and advanced counting techniques, among other thinGiven the inherently discrete nature of the bit, this
subject founds all of computer science.
The canonical text for computer scientists is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics">Concrete Mathematics</a>,
but I prefer <a href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html"> Discrete Mathematics - An Open Introduction</a>

        If you do wish to contribute a modification to a project, 
        then you have a few responsibilities:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Write code that can be read easily
                <ul>
                    <li>Code is read much more often than it is written</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Write code that can be improved
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep it simple</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Write code that is modular
                <ul>
                    <li>Account for future development</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        But most of all, do one thing and do it well.
