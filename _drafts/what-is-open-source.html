        Although the spirit of Free Software is simple
        enough&mdash; it respects its users&mdash;

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>

    <p>
        Free software may be used for any purpose, including 
        commercial purposes.
        Neither the Free Software Foundation nor the 
        Open Source Initiative attempt to differentiate between
        "good" and "bad" (or "evil") uses of the works, and
        simply allow all.
    </p>

    <p>
        
    </p>

    <p>
        It's important to recognize that the idea of free software was
        conceived of by a hacker, on behalf of hackers.
        If one keeps this in mind, the rest of this discussion 
        will fall into place.

    <h2><em>Not</em> Collaboration</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Recall that <em>open source</em> is a synonym for
            <em>free software.</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Properly speaking, open-source qualifies how
        software is distributed and used&mdash; Not how
        it is produced.<sup><a href="#references" title="Eghbal p44">[a]</a></sup>
        Notably, it requires human-readable "source" be available 
        whenever machine-readable instructions are available.
        The term does not restrict
        the organizational structure adopted to produce
        these works, and many open-source projects are <em>not</em> 
        open to collaboration.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, GNU is not collaborative:
        While users are permitted to
        modify and redistribute GNU's works, those modifications 
        were never intended to make their way back to official GNU source.
        That is, the originators of the term <em>free software</em>
        eschewed open collaborative effort, and GNU products
        were (are) free for its own sake.
    </p>

    <p>
        Admittedly, the trend of the last several decades has been
        to be open to collaboration.
        Most notably, doing so fosters the success of the project.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a consequence, open-source is often <em>collaborative,</em> but 
        it is not a synonym for <em>collaboration.</em>

    <h3>A Collection of Projects</h3>

    <p>
        There is usually a deliberate delineation between <em>user</em> and 
        <em>developer.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        The projects that constitute the modern open-source domain
        are pursued independently.
        While members of the open-source community generally try
        to work together, each is free to pick up, 
        Modifications are submitted <em>to projects,</em>
        inspected on a case-by-case basis, and then either
        accepted into the project or rejected.
    </p>

    <p>
        This model is by nature distributed, with anyone anywhere
        welcome to submit (completed) modifications to present works.
        Project leaders take on the responsibility of their work's 
        overall well-being, and can modify the code however they see
        fit. 
        The idea was "Accidentally Revolutionary," and has
        dominated open-source since.
    </p>

    <p>
        It should be noted that there is no "rule" that collaboration
        is restricted to hobbyists, and being inclusive with
        respect to organizations fosters project success.
        Facebook, for example, has put considerable effort
        into Linux's new <code><a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">btrfs</a></code>.<sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/824855/">[h]</a></sup>

    <h2>Moneyed?</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>
            Formally, we will only be considering those qualities
            shared by both <em>Free Software</em> and <em>Open Source.</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        All open-source software may be redistributed by any user.  
        This qualification may be explicit, as in the case of
        copyleft licenses; or, it may be implicit, by
        <em>not forbidding</em> redistribution, as in the case
        of public domain works.
        In either case, this stipulation does not forbid 
        the sale of open-source software.
    </p>

    <p>
        While free software is traditionally a hobbyist' production,
        and is traditionally available free of charge, there
        are/can-be/will-be moneyed interests seeking to maximize
        profit by selling open-source products, as in the case
        of Audacity.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the first place, the rights of free software apply 
        only <em>to users:</em> While every user has access to source
        code and may redistribute the work, neither the compiled product
        nor the source code must be made available to the public.
        Any user, though, may make both project and source publicly
        available.

    <h2>Ownership in Open-Source</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Here we will restrict our language to the term <em>release.</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        I prefer instead to identify what <em>is</em> owned in
        open-source: 
        <em>You the user own your copy of the software, until you
        decide to release it.</em>
        Thereupon, any user owns a copy, and may release it
        themselves&mdash; etc etc..
        Thus, open source one type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-culture_movement">free work</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Probably the most important component is the codebase&mdash;
        the source repository.
        Again, until this repository is released, its owner 
        decides everything about it, including what goes into it,
        and when (if) it is released.
        Linus Torvalds, for example, has the power to <em>never release</em>
        another kernel; he could simply collect and perfect the
        source on his own.
        Point is, the repository maintainer is in no way obliged to 
        respond to any proposed commit&mdash; They don't even have
        to respond to your email.
    </p>

    <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>

    <p>
        To Naida Eghbal, who worked at GitHub for two years,
        open source is a kind of content, and GitHub itself is
        a kind of platform.
        This is perhaps the shrewdest interpretation of open-source
        and must additionally be qualified: 
        Software has pragmatic value, and therefore existential worth,
        whereas other forms of content, strictly speaking, do not.
    </p>

    <p>
        For economist...
        collaborative open-source is different means of 
        organizing the 'means of production'.
    </p>

    <p>
        So we see that open source is different things to different
        people.
        To many of its participants (whom often refer to themselves
        as <em>contributors</em>), open-source is fundamentally
        altruistic.
        I don't hold with this notion, since the best works have 
        consistently been self-serving.
    </p>

    <p>
        To me, open source is purity of motivation.
        It is a tangible good created for its own sake.
        Without the 
    </p>

    <p>
        The modern domain is fundamentally distributed...
