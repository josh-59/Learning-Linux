    <p>
        Sharing computing resources was common practice in the 1970's.  
        Interactive computing was just becoming feasible, and 
        machines were prohibitively expensive&mdash; purchased by institutions 
        rather than individuals.
        Code sharing followed naturally.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pursuant to anti-monopoly legislation imposed upon AT&amp;T,
        Bell Labs was required to distribute UNIX source for the cost of media
        (then, tapes).
        It is rumored that Ken Thompson signed each copy with <em>Love, Ken.</em><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix">[a]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        It was with the sixth edition of UNIX that management began to realize
        that the software had value.
        AT&T lawyers stepped in, first copyrighting the name
        <em>UNIX</em>, then restricting the distribution of UNIX source.
    </p>

    <p>
        The changes from 5th? edition to 6th? reduced to a "<code>diff</code> tape", 
        a tape recording all relevant changes to source. 
        Its distribution was explicitly forbidden by AT&amp;T lawyers,
        but found its way outside the Labs nonetheless.
        Many possibilities were put forth as explanations of this;
        the lawyers were ultimately told, 
        "...It fell off the back of a truck."

        An operating system is a piece of software which facilitates
        the use of a computer.
        To this end, its two main responsibilities are to support running
        programs and to maintain persistent data.
        GNU/Linux belongs to a large class of operating systems known as
        <em>UNIX-like</em>, having an architecture, design philosophy, and
        system-call interface similar to the 
        70's-era operating system.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="unix" class="content">
    <h2>UNIX: Origins</h2>

    <p>
        The UNIX operating system was born in late 1969 at AT&amp;T's
        <em>Bell Laboratories,</em> in the shadow
        of Multics.
        Multics was a project intended to enable the
        commercialization of computing as a service, in a business model 
        similar to telephone or electricity:
        Customers would connect their keyboard and monitor to a central mainframe, 
        then pay for computation on an as-used basis.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">[1]</a></sup>
        Multics was a large, and in many ways, <a href="https://multicians.org/features.html">novel</a> project. 
        Developed at MIT, in collaboration with General Electric and AT&amp;T, 
        the project never realized its dream, and in 1969 AT&amp;T withdrew its support.
    </p>

    <p>
        At Bell Labs, in the aftermath of Multics, operating systems developers 
        Kenneth Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna
        found themselves without a clear project.<sup><a href="http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[2]</a></sup>
        They proposed many ideas, but none were accepted, and
        no new machines were purchased.<sup><a href="http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        After finding a disused <a href="https://www.soemtron.org/pdp7.html">PDP-7</a>,
        Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie rewrote
        the game <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Travel_(video_game)">Space Travel</a></em> 
        for it.<sup><a href="http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[2]</a></sup>
        Thompson then continued to work with the machine, implementing a
        filesystem that he, Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday had devised on
        paper.<sup><a href="http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        At some point in 1969, Thompson realized that he was close to
        an operating system:  All it needed was an
        assembler, a text editor, a shell and an <em>exec</em> system 
        call.<sup><a href="#references" title="Kernighan, p34">[3]</a></sup>
        The <em>exec</em> call was "trivial", and the other three components were
        done in one week 
        each.<sup><a href="#references" title="Kernighan, p34">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        The software continued to be developed into a minimal, feasible, 
        multi-user, time-sharing operating system, now known as <em>UNIX.</em>
        The novel system 
        <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/dmr.pdf">well outperformed for its size</a>, 
        and its popularity was due in part to its
        ability to run on varied and relatively inexpensive hardware.<sup><a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_unix-review_1986-10_4_10/page/32/mode/2up">[4]</a></sup>

<div id="unix-architecture" class="content">
    <h2>The UNIX Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        UNIX had a clear, simple, well-documented architecture that
        <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Unix_history-simple.svg">inspired many operating systems</a>. 
        It is organized as a hierarchy of layers,
        with each layer building upon the ones beneath it, and supporting
        the layers above it.
    </p>

    <img src="assets/img/linux-architecture.png" style="height: 400px;">

    <p>
        <strong>Hardware:</strong>
        The core of any computer is its hardware.
        Each piece of hardware has a software interface defined by the
        engineers that created it; these interfaces are varied at best.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Drivers:</strong>
        Drivers interact with hardware, and simplify the interface between
        kernel and hardware.
        These pieces of software are the deepest and most remote elements
        of any operating system.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Kernel:</strong>
        The heart of any UNIX-like operating system is its 
        <a href="http://linffo.org/kernel.html">kernel</a>.
        The kernel is responsible for
        scheduling the CPU, allotting memory, 
        maintaining file integrity, and many other tasks.
        It is an involved piece of software,
        effectively, the "brains" of the operation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>System Calls:</strong>
        The set of operations that a kernel is willing to undertake is 
        defined by the system calls it supports.
        The UNIX architecture is characterized by six essential system calls:
        <em>fork, exec, open, close, read,</em> and
        <em>write.</em><sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
        Both <em>fork</em> and <em>exec</em> are concerned with launching
        programs, while <em>open, close, read,</em> and <em>write</em>
        are concerned with files.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Processes:</strong>
        A <em>process</em> is an executing program.
        Within the UNIX architecture, processes run the show:
        The kernel is entirely dependant upon processes to tell it what to do.
        Effectively, the kernel has no "mind" of its own.

        <center>Richard Stallman</center>
    </div>

    <p>
        The first attempt at producing a deliberately free and open-source UNIX clone 
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.en.html#f1">was announced</a> 
        by Richard Stallman in 1983.
        Stallman had been working at MIT's AI Laboratory for over a decade,
        and had grown accustomed to its culture of sharing source code:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="width: 55%;">
        "If you saw someone using an unfamiliar and interesting program, you
        could always ask to see the source code, so that you could read it, change
        it, or cannibalize parts of it to make a new
        program."<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">[6]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Yet, proprietary software was becoming the norm, with students working
        on projects intended for profit,<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-programs-should-be-shared.html">[7]</a></sup>
        and companies going so far as to require nondisclosure agreements be 
        signed to get an executable.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">[6]</a></sup>
        On September 27, 1983, Stallman announced his resolution:
        To produce a "complete UNIX-compatible software system," and to
        "give it away free."<a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.en.html#f1"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
        He called the project <a href="https://gnu.org">GNU</a>, a recursive
        acronym for
        <em>GNU's Not UNIX.</em><sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html">[9]</a></sup>
    </p>

   
    <p>
        At the time of announcement, Stallman had not yet quantified his
        own intentions behind the word <em>free.</em>
        Certainly, "a free copy" did not embody the
        culture of code-sharing MIT was once home to.
        More, he did not wish to put the code in the public domain because
        modified versions of it it could become proprietary.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft#History">[10]</a></sup>
        By 1985, Stallman had sorted these issues out:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
            GNU is not in the public domain. Everyone will be permitted to
            modify and redistribute GNU, but no distributor will be allowed to
            restrict its further redistribution. That is to say, proprietary
            modifications will not be allowed. I want to make sure that all
            versions of GNU remain free.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">[11]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Thus, the notion of 
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">free software</a>
        was born: 
        Users can run, study, modify, copy and distribute GNU,
        but <em>if</em> they distribute them, then those freedoms must be preserved.
        These stipulations were formalized in the GNU
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#History">General Public License</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        About it, Linus Torvalds would later write:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "Under the terms of the GPL, money is not the issue.
        You can charge a million bucks if someone is willing to pay
        for it, but you have to make sources available.
        And the person you give or sell the source to has to have
        all the rights you have.
        It's a brilliant device."<sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>

        To create an entire operating system is an enormous task, but
        by 1990, the GNU Project had

    <h2>The Linux Kernel </h2>

    <p>
        On August 25, 1991, a Finnish graduate student by the name of Linus Torvalds
        announced his own free operating system project.
        Again following the architecture of the UNIX operating system,
        his project was intended to be "...just a hobby, won't be big and
        professional like GNU."<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[14]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right" style="font-size: 11pt;">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Properly speaking, the name <em>Linux</em> refers only to the Linux kernel.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Whereas the GNU Project sought to
        produce an entire operating system, Linus restricted his
        attention to the kernel.
        By October of 1991, GNU's Bash, GCC, Make and other
        programs were running on his creation.<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[14]</a></sup>
        He soon released it under the GNU General Public License, Version 2.
        Later, he would write:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "The fact is, to make Linux usable, I had relied on a lot of tools that had
        been distributed freely over the Internet&mdash;I had hoisted myself up
        on the shoulders of giants.  The most important of these free software
        programs was the GCC compiler."<sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Linus Torvalds became interested in operating systems after
            finding an error in the source code of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL">Sinclair QL's</a> QDOS.
            <sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
            In college, Andrew Tanenbaum's
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_Systems:_Design_and_Implementation"><em>Operating Systems: Design and Implementation</em></a>
            took this interest to new heights.<sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Interest in the kernel flourished, in large part because
        of the informality of the project:
        <a href="pre/free-minix-like-kernel-sources-for-386-at.html">Everybody was invited,</a> if only
        to tinker.
        This development model&mdash; "release early and often, delegate everything you can,
        be open to the point of promiscuity"<sup><a href="#references">[15]</a></sup>&mdash; <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html#catbmain">raised eyebrows</a> at the time,
        but has proven sound in virtue of its overwhelming success:
        The model quickly came to dominate the open-source landscape, and
        the Linux kernel has become the most-used UNIX-like kernel of all time,
        powering supercomputers, webservers and nerds' laptops everywhere.

        Linus Torvalds remains the maintainer of the Development branch,
        and often remarks upon the kernel's latest releases.
        Another public figure of today's Linux development effort is Greg Kroah-Hartman
        (pronounced "<em>Crow</em>-Hartman"). 
        He is lead maintainer of the stable branch, in addition to various subsystems.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kroah-Hartman">[16]</a></sup>
        According to he, interest in the kernel continues to
        grow, with 1200 new developers contributing each
        year.<sup><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/26/linux_kernel_intel/">[17]</a></sup>
        Their main development bottlenecks are code review and
        maintainership.<sup><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/26/linux_kernel_intel/">[17]</a></sup>

    <h2> Linux Distributions: A Brief History </h2>

    <p>
        The first versions of the Linux kernel were available
        only in source-code form, and required compilation on a separate
        host machine.<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[14]</a></sup>
        No other software was included, so that the
        creation of a functional Linux-based machine required the user to 
        obtain, compile and assemble a number of disparate software components.

        <center style="font-size: 12pt;">HJ Lu's Boot/Root Floppies</center>
    </div>

    <p>
        In 1992, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HJ_Lu">HJ Lu</a>
        began packaging utilities alongside the kernel and distributing the
        collection on a pair of 5.25" disks.<sup><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/history-of-early-linux-distros/">[20]</a><a href="https://itsfoss.com/earliest-linux-distros/">[21]</a></sup>
        Known as the <em>boot/root</em> floppies, they are
        the first known Linux distribution.<sup><a href="https://itsfoss.com/earliest-linux-distros/">[21]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Linux's first widely recognized and used distribution was, ironically,
        a commercial venture, <em>Soft Landing System</em>.<sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/">[22]</a></sup>
        Released in late 1992, SLS was sold under the slogan "Gentle Touchdowns for DOS Bailouts",<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System">[23]</a></sup>
        but users complained that the software was buggy,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System">[23]</a><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[24]</a></sup> and when its developers
        decided to change the executable file format, began to leave.<sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/">[22]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h3> Two Responses </h3>

    <p>
        In late 1992, Patrick Volkerding needed a LISP interpreter for a project
        at school, and, having heard that <em>clisp</em> ran on SLS Linux,
        downloaded them both.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[24]</a></sup>
        His professor got wind, and asked Patrick to help install the software
        on school computers.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[24]</a></sup>
        Volkerding walked him through installing, fixing and patching SLS, and
        afterward, his professor asked, "Is there some way we can fix the install disks so
        that the new machines will have these fixes right away?"<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[24]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        So Volkerding began improving SLS, and internally named his project
        <em>Slackware,</em> not wanting it to be taken too 
        seriously.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[24]</a></sup>
        By May, though, the improvements were, "more than just cosmetic," and 
        his friends convinced him to release it onto the internet.
        The first release proved so popular that the
        number of download requests crashed the system hosting it,<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[24]</a></sup>
        and Slackware would be, for several years, the de-facto Linux distribution.
    </p>

    <p>
        Volkerding hadn't intended to produce a distribution,<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[24]</a></sup> but still
        maintains <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> today.<sup><a href="http://www.slackware.com/about">[25]</a></sup>
        The Slackware Linux Project is aimed at producing, "the most UNIX-like
        Linux distribution out there."<sup><a href="http://www.slackware.com/info/">[26]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        At about the same time, Ian Murdock grew frustrated with SLS Linux,<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[27]</a></sup>
        and, more, sought a better solution to distribution creation than
        single-person or closed-room schemes.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[27]</a></sup>
        Ian wanted an operating system that lived up to the <em>Linux</em> name,
        was carefully and conscientiously assembled, and which was maintained
        with equal diligence.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[27]</a></sup>
        In particular, he wanted a free operating system that could
        compete with commercial distributions.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[27]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Murdock decided to make the distribution creation process open, 
        thereby dividing the burden of maintainership while ensuring satisfaction of users' requirements.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[27]</a></sup>
        He named it <a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a>,
        a portmanteau of <em>Debra,</em> his wife, and <em>Ian,</em> himself.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/intro.en.html">[28]</a></sup>
        The project attracted developers, and today around
        a thousand people volunteer their time.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/intro/philosophy">[29]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Debian is one of the most respected distributions of our time.
        The quantity of software available through its repositories is unparalleled,
        and it is oft-used as an upstream source for derivate distributions.

        With the internet came <a href="https://distrowatch.com/">many</a> distributions.
        Since they are each based around the Linux kernel, 
        and utilize key components given away by the GNU Project, 
        we refer to them as <em>GNU/Linux.</em>

            Mint is one of several Debian derivatives.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        My favorite distribution is <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint,</a>
        but then, I'm a simple guy.
        Mint is a characteristically professional operating system,
        <!--and <strike>I used to wear polos to school</strike>-->
        and focuses on productivity&mdash; that means you'll be up and
        running before you know it.
        It is extremely new-user friendly, yet maintains the performance
        of any other UNIX-like operating system.
    </p>

    <p>
        Recently, Mint 19 began shipping with 
        <em><a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift">Timeshift</a>,</em> 
        a tool that automaticaly takes snapshots of the filesystem,
        and allows the user to restore the system to some earlier date.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mint offers the Cinnamon desktop environment;
        Windows users will feel right at home.
        I find it to be an attractive desktop, but it's only moderately
        customizable.
        Like many users, I want a desktop environment that stays out of my way,
        and Cinnamon does exactly that.
    </p>

        <center>Linux Mint 20.1 "Ulyssa", Released 2021</center>
    </div>

    <p>
        What sets Mint apart from other distributions is that tools like 
        <em>Timeshift</em> and <em>Cinnamon</em> are preinstalled and ready to use.
        When an example operating system is required in this book, 
        Mint will be used, but similar remarks apply to 
        virtually any distribution, with a little perusing.

    <h4>Open Source</h4>

    <p>
        In the forty years since Richard Stallman began GNU
        (pronounced <em>guh-nu</em>), the free software landscape has seen a
        great deal of growth.
        In 1998, the term <em>open source</em> was invented as
        <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html">a less abrasive synonym</a>
        for <em>free software:</em>
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        We realized it was time to dump the confrontational attitude that has been
        associated with 'free software' in the past and sell the idea strictly on
        the same pragmatic, business-case grounds that motivated
        Netscape.<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981206185148/http://www.opensource.org/history.html">[30]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The result was a wealth of media attention, the
        <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> and the
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> project.
        Both GNU and the OSI agree that their respective terms are
        nearly synonymous.<sup><a href="https://opensource.org/faq#free-software">[31]</a><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-open-overlap.html">[32]</a></sup>
        In this work, and in life, we will use "open-source"
        interchangeably with "free software".
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Today, the most popular open-source license is MIT's, by far.<sup><a href="https://github.blog/2015-03-09-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com/">[33]</a></sup>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        In addition, more developers have taken part, and introduced a number of
        licenses to suit their needs.
        These licenses can be divided into two classes:
        Permissive licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache, BSD) do not perpetuate
        themselves, and so indirectly allow derivate works to become proprietary.
        Nonpermissive licenses (e.g., GPL, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Public_License">MPL</a>), 
        on the other hand, <em>do</em> perpetuate themselves, and so
        represent a type of copyleft.<sup><a href="https://opensource.org/faq#permissive">[34]</a><a href="https://opensource.org/faq#copyleft">[35]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        To be honest, a lot of developers have said, <em>To hell with this,</em>
        and introduced such novelties as the
        <a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~phk/">Beerware License</a>,
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL">Do What The **** You Want License</a>,
        and the <a href="https://unlicense.org/">Unlicense</a> (quite popular).
        These each place code in the public domain;
        from there, anyone can claim it as their own, and can put it in any other work,
        under any other license.
