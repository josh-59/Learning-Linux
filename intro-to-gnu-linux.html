      An operating system is a collection of software designed to facilitate
      the use of a computer.
      To this end, its two main responsibilities are to support running
      programs, known as processes, and to maintain persistent data, usually in the form of files.
      In addition, operating systems ease the task of creating
      useful programs (i.e., computer programming).
      Modern GNU/Linux offers the single best programming environment
      available today.

    <h2>Unix Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      GNU/Linux belongs to a large class of operating systems called
      <em>Unix-like</em>, sometimes referred to by <em>*nix</em>.
      The Unix operating system had a clear and well-documented architecture,
      which has been replicated many times in both open-source and proprietary contexts.
      The canonical depiction of its architecture is as follows:
    </p>

    <img src="assets/img/linux-architecture.png" style="height: 400px;">

    <p>
      <strong>Hardware:</strong>
      At the heart of any machine is its hardware.
      Each piece of hardware
      has a software interface defined by the engineers that
      created it.
      These interfaces are varied at best.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Drivers:</strong>
      Directly interacting with hardware and providing a more-uniform interface to
      each piece is the task of the system's <em>drivers</em>. This software layer
      represents the deepest and most remote element of any operating system.
      While drivers can be installed on an as-needed basis, in Linux
      the tendency is to include many drivers, and use only those that are required.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Kernel:</strong>
      While the heart of any machine is its hardware, the heart of any
      Unix-like operating system is its kernel.
      The kernel uses drivers to direct the actions of the machine, at the
      behest of processes.
      Because the expectations that we have for the system are great
      (running multiple programs concurrently, never losing files nor parts of
      files, weeks-long stability),
      this is a <em>large</em> and <em>involved</em> piece of software.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>System Calls:</strong>
      In order to permit interaction with the kernel, each
      Unix-like operating system employs a well-defined set of system calls.
      Interaction with the kernel is restricted to the system-call interface.
       From a source-code point of view, these "look" and "act" like ordinary function
       calls, but their actions are not restricted to user-space; rather, they
       transcend the software hierarchy, often making changes at the hardware level.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Processes:</strong>
      From <em>The Linux Programming Interface</em> by Michael Kerrisk,
      "A process is an instance of an executing program."<sup><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup>
      On a *nix system, processes are the only means that a user has to interact with the system.
      Processes are a critical component of a functioning Unix-like operating system.
    </p>

      <h2>The Linux Kernel</h2>
      <p>
        Properly speaking, the name <em>Linux</em> refers to the Linux kernel.
        The Linux kernel was began by Linus Torvalds in 1991, then a graduate student
        of the University of Helsinki.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">[1]</a></sup>
        Following the architecture of the Unix operating system,
        he wrote an open-source kernel as "...a hobby, won't be big and professional like [the GNU kernel]."
        He soon released it publicly under the free-and-open-source <em>GNU General Public License</em>, version 2.

      The deployment of a Unix-like operating system is contingent upon
      the execution of some user-space programs.
    </div>

    <p>
        - Kernel
        - System Call API
        - Standard "Core" utilities


      System Call API:
      The operating system exposes a system call interface to each
      user-space process, allowing a process to instruct the kernel to carry out
      actions on its behalf.
        - POSIX / SUSv4
        - #?



      Kernel:
      Between these two elements is the kernel.

      What is a kernel?
          - Began by Linus Torvals, the Linux Kernel

      The kernel is the software layer between user-space programs and hardware drivers.
      This is the largest software layer in the operating system construct; it is
      tasked with maintaining the filesystem, ensuring user-space processes do not
      interfere with each other, and scheduling processes in a fair and reasonable manner.

      A great number of kernels implement the Unix system-call API,

      "Core" Utilites:
      The standard collection of programs that help define the working "Linux" OS;
      Some of these are critical to operating system functionality (?? Examples ??)
        - GNU


      Bundling It All Up: The Distribution
        An operating system, precompiled for use.
        It includes a kernel, selected drivers, and selected utilities.

        Because Linux is open-source, it's relatively easy to produce your own distribution,
        and because it's free, anyone can do it.


      What will run Linux?
        - Just about anything!
        Pinebook Pro:
         a compelling alternative to mid-ranged Chromebooks that people convert into Linux laptops.

      Mac-style Kubuntu
