    Linux Distributions: A Brief History:

    <h4> Linux Distributions: A Brief History </h4>

        Early Linux Kernels:
            The first versions of the Linux kernel were distributed
            in source-code form.<sup><a href="#references">[10]</a></sup> 

        HJ Lu's Boot/Root floppies:
            In 1992, developers had the idea to start packaging utilities with the Linux kernel https://www.maketecheasier.com/history-of-early-linux-distros/
            First known distribution, and came on a pair of 5.25" floppie diskettes.https://itsfoss.com/earliest-linux-distros/
            and worked only on the 386.  

            "After a while you got a command prompt."

        SLS:
            Between 1992 and 1994, there were only a few distributions of Linux;
            the most significant of these was SLS, Softlanding Linux System.
            The company was founded in 1992 by Peter MacDonald
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System

            A commercial distribution

            was the first widely used Linux distribution.
                https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/

        Slackware:
            Patrick Volkerding 

        Debian:
            Rather than try to anticipate the needs of the community, Ian
            simply made the process open, so that the community could participate
            in the distribution creation process.
            
            https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html
                "Distributions eliminate the need for the user to locate,
                download, compile, install and integrate a fairly large number
                of essential tools to assemble a working Linux system."
    
                "The Debian design process is open to ensure that the system is of the
                highest quality and that it reflects the needs of the user community."

            https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution
                "This document describes the organisational structure for the formal
                decision-making in the Project."

            https://www.debian.org/intro/philosophy
                "Debian was begun in August 1993 by Ian Murdock, as a new distribution
                which would be made openly, in the spirit of
                Linux and GNU."
                "Debian is produced by almost a thousand active developers spread
                around the world who volunteer in their spare time."

        Ubuntu:
            Today's most popular desktop distribution.

        </div>

        Conclusion:
            With the internet came a veritable cornacopia of Linux distributions.

            Since these are each based around the same kernel, and the kernel
            has the property that it does not change behavior across versions,
            they are all similar operating systems.

            Some strive to be <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/6/linux-distros-to-try">very small</a>, running on ~300MB of RAM;
            others strive to be <a href="https://itsfoss.com/beautiful-linux-distributions/">very beautiful</a>, but relatively few strive to be <a href="https://itsfoss.com/best-linux-beginners/">very good</a>.
            For newcomers, I might recommend

        An operating system is a collection of software which facilitates
        the use of a computer.
        To this end, its two main responsibilities are to support running
        programs, callled processes, and to maintain persistent
        data, in the form of files.
        In addition, operating systems ease the task of creating
        useful programs by offering programmers a logical architecture
        and predictable environment.
        GNU/Linux has evolved to offer the single best 
        programming environment available today.

<div id="unix" class="content">
    <h2>UNIX</h2>
    <p>
        The Unix Operating System was born in late 1969 at Bell Labs, in the shadow
        of <a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">Multics</a>.
        Multics was an operating system intended to
        commercialize computing by offering it as a service, similar to telephone or
        electricity.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">[1]</a></sup>
        The intent was for users to connect <a href="terminals-and-shells.html">terminals</a>
        to a central mainframe, then pay for computation on an as-used basis.
    </p>

    <p>
        Being a joint venture between MIT, AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories, and General
        Electric, Multics was a large and, in many ways, novel, project.
        It introduced many new operating systems ideas&mdash; among them,
        the hierarchical
        file structure.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">[1]</a></sup>
        For a variety of reasons, the project never realized its dream, and in 1969
        Bell Laboratories abandoned it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within Bell Labs, management put operating systems research on
        the backburner, and refused to purchase new computing
        equipment.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#references">[3]</a></sup>
        After finding a disused <a href="https://www.soemtron.org/pdp7.html">PDP-7</a>,
        Ken Thompson rewrote <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Travel_(video_game)">Space Travel</a></em> for
        it.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#references">[3]</a></sup>
        In the process, he accrued the tools and skills necessary to implement
        a filesystem he and others at Bell Laboratories had been devising on paper.<sup><a href="#references">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        At some point in 1969, while working on his filesystem, Ken Thompson realized that he was three weeks
        from an operating system.  All he needed was an
        <em>exec</em> call, an assembler, a text editor and a shell.
        In 1970, the new operating system was christened <em>UNIX,</em>
        as a "somewhat treacherous pun on
        MULTICS."<sup><a href="#references">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Owing in part to the restrictive nature of available
        hardware, the budding operating system focused
        on simplicity.<sup><a href="#references">[4]</a></sup>
        The earliest versions of the new operating system were put to use
        internally by Bell Labs to assist in patent
        applications.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#references">[3]</a></sup>
        The software then moved away from its nest under obtuse licenses to
        universities, where its source code, though not free, was studied and documented.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
        Finally, Unix became commercially available, to principally
        to corporate clients.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>

<div id="unix-architecture" class="content">
    <h2>The Unix Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        Unix had a simple, clear and well-documented architecture
        that
        <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Unix_history-simple.svg">inspired many operating systems</a>, including GNU/Linux.
        It is organized as a heirarchy of layers:
        Each layer builds upon the one beneathe it, and supports
        the layer immediately above it.
    </p>

    <img src="assets/img/linux-architecture.png" style="height: 400px;">

    <p>
        <strong>Hardware:</strong>
        At the heart of any computer is its hardware.
        Each piece of hardware has a software interface defined by the
        engineering team that created it.
        These interfaces are varied at best.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Drivers:</strong>
        Drivers interact with hardware, and provide the kernel with
        a more-uniform interface to each piece.
        This software layer
        represents the deepest and most remote element of any operating system.
        Although drivers can be installed on an as-needed basis, in GNU/Linux
        the tendency is to include many drivers, and use only those that are required.
        Drivers are not usually written by the hardware's engineers or vendors.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Kernel:</strong>
        While the heart of any computer is its hardware, the heart any
        Unix-like operating system is its kernel.
        The kernel is responsible for 
        scheduling the CPU, allotting memory, supporting running programs
        and maintaining file integrity;
        it is a large and involved piece of software.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>System Calls:</strong>
        The operations that the kernel can undertake are, classically,
        defined by the system calls it supports.
        Unix-like operating systems have six essential system calls:
        <em>fork, exec, open, close, read,</em> and
        <em>write.</em><sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
        Both <em>fork</em> and <em>exec</em> are concerned with processes,
        while <em>open, close, read,</em> and <em>write</em> are concerned with
        files.
        These effectively permit interaction with the kernel, and it is
        often useful to know how the kernel responds to system calls.
        However, processes cannot dictate how the kernel carries system calls out;
        in fact, the kernel may deny a system call (if, say, a file does not
        exist, or the calling process does not have appropriate authority).
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Processes:</strong>
        A process, sometimes called a "user-space process" or "user-land process,"
        is an executing program.
        Within Unix and other Unix-like operating systems, processes run the entire show:
        The kernel is entirely dependant upon processes
        to tell it what to do.
        It follows that there must exist at least one "trusted" process within
        user-land, to get other processes on their feet&mdash;
        and this is exactly the case.
        This is one of the more beautiful elements of the
        Unix architecture.

<div class="content" id="free-as-in-freedom">
    <h2>Free as in Freedom</h2>
    <p>
        The first attempt at producing a deliberately free and open-source Unix
        clone
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.en.html#f1">was announced</a> by Richard Stallman in 1983.
        Stallman was, at the time, a graduate student at
        MIT's AI Laboratory,<sup><a href="#references">[6]</a></sup> and
        his project was called "GNU," a recursive acronym for <em>GNU's Not Unix.</em><sup><a href="#references">[7]</a></sup>
    </p>

     
    <p>
        To create an entire operating system is an enormous task, but,
        seven years later, the GNU Project had
        either found or written all major components&ndash; except one, the kernel.<sup><a href="#references">[7]</a></sup>
        GNU's own kernel, dubbed <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/">Hurd</a>, has yet to be completed.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4> From <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">gnu.org</a>:</h4>
        <p>
            “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community.
            Roughly, it means that <strong>the users have the freedom to run, copy,
            distribute, study, change and improve the software.</strong>[sic]
        </p>
    </div>



    <p>
        Today, the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</a> is well-regarded for producing high-quality, well-documented
        free software;
        they are as "official" as the open-source community gets.
        In particular, their compiler collection,
        <code><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org">gcc</a></code>, contains the 
        de-facto C compiler of the open-source community, if not the world.
        It is the only compiler capable of building Linux kernels.<sup><a href="#references">[8]</a></sup>
    </p>


    <h3> GNU General Public License </h3>

    <p>
        Of arguably greater importance than the software created by the 
        GNU Project was the license invented to release it under.
        Called the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#gpl">GNU General Public License,</a> 
        software released under it ensures its 
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">users' freedoms</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        About the device, Linus Torvalds writes:
    </p>

    <p style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%;">
        "Under the terms of the GPL, money is not the issue.
        You can charge a million bucks if someone is willing to pay
        for it, but you have to make sources available.  
        And the person you give or sell the source to has to have
        all the rights you have. It's a brilliant device."<sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>

        GNU remains both <a href="https://www.gnu.org/keepingup.html">active and prominent</a>

    <h2>The Linux Kernel </h2>

    <p>
        On August 25, 1991, a Finnish graduate student by the name of Linus Torvalds
        announced his own free operating system project.
        Again following the architecture of the Unix operating system,
        his project was intended to be "...just a hobby, won't be big and
        professional like GNU."<sup><a href="#references">[10]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right" style="font-size: 11pt;">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Properly speaking, the name <em>Linux</em> refers only to the Linux kernel.
        </p>
    </div>


    <p>
        While the GNU Project sought to
        produce an entire operating system, Linus restricted his
        attention to creating a kernel.
        By October of 1991, GNU's Bash, GCC, Make and other
        programs were running on his creation.<sup><a href="#references">[10]</a></sup>
        He soon released it under the GNU General Public License, Version 2.
        Later, he would write:
    </p>
    
    <p style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%;">
        "The fact is, to make Linux usable, I had relied on a lot of tools that had
        been distributed freely over the Internet&mdash;I had hoisted myself up
        on the shoulders of giants.  The most important of these free software
        programs was the GCC compiler."<sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
    </p>

    
    
    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Linus Torvalds became interested in operating systems after
            finding an error in the source code of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL">Sinclair QL's</a> QDOS.
            <sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
            In college, Andrew Tanenbaum's
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_Systems:_Design_and_Implementation"><em>Operating Systems: Design and Implementation</em></a>
            took this interest to new heights.<sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Interest in the kernel flourished, in large part because
        of the informality of the project:
        <a href="assets/free-minix-like-kernel-sources-for-386-at.html">Everybody was invited,</a> if only
        to tinker.
        This development model&mdash; "release early and often, delegate everything you can,
        be open to the point of promiscuity"<sup><a href="#references">[11]</a></sup>&mdash; <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html#catbmain">raised eyebrows</a> at the time,
        but has proven sound in virtue of its overwhelming success:
        The Linux kernel has become the most successful Unix-like kernel of all time,
        and accounts for fully half of the "GNU/Linux" namesake.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/2.Process.html?highlight=merge window">kernel development process</a>
        has become (somewhat) more structured since 1991, and today uses an (organic)
        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/programming-in-nix.html#train-schedules">train-schedule</a> approach.
        Linus Torvalds remains the maintainer of the Development branch,
        and often remarks upon the kernel's latest releases.

        A major figure of today's Linux development team is Greg Kroah-Hartman 
        (pronounced "<em>Crow</em>-Hartman"), who maintains the Stable branch, 
        in addition to various subsystems.<sup><a href="#references">[12]</a></sup>
        According to Mr. Kroah-Hartman, interest in the kernel continues to
        grow, with 1200 new developers contributing each
        year.<sup><a href="#references">[13]</a></sup>
        Their main development bottlenecks are code review and
        maintainership.<sup><a href="#references">[13]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Although the Linux kernel began as a hobby, it is an occupation
        for some, and serious affair for many.
        In particular, the kernel development team
        takes great care not to break
        user-space,<sup><a href="#references">[14]</a></sup>
        meaning that programs that <em>did</em> work will continue to
        work.
        In this way, they ensure the long-term stability of Linux-based
        systems.<sup><a href="#references">[15]</a></sup>

    <h2> Linux Distributions </h2>

    <p>
        A Linux distribution is a collection of software that, 
        when installed, yields a functioning operating system.
        Each includes some variant of the Linux kernel, some core utilities,
        and, usually, some other user-space applications (e.g., Firefox).
        The collection is tested to work and packaged in a fashion that
        facilitates installation (usually, an ISO disk image);
        because the assemblers of these operating systems do not typically
        lay claim to the software, it is more accurate to say that they are 
        <em>distributing</em> others' software.
    </p>

    <p>
        Linux distributions are more similar than dissimilar.
        They tend <em>not</em> to be strictly incompatible operating systems,
        and so 
        Think of them as flavors of the Unix architecture, rather than
        strictly incompatible operating systems.
        The oldest distribution that's still maintained is
        <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a>, first released
        in 1993.<sup><a href="#references">[16]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Nerd Heaven:</h4>
        <p>
            Nearly all GNU/Linux distributions ship with
            programming tools installed&mdash; Expect to find
            <code>gcc</code>, <code>python</code>, <code>make</code>
            and others ready to go!
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The creators and maintainers of a distribution often have precise goals for their project.
        For instance, the <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> project
        intends to produce a stable operating system appropriate for use in
        servers, while the <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a> project
        wishes to stay closer to the cutting edge, and is willing to
        sacrifice some stability to do so.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Almost always, a distribution becomes a project, around which
        a community forms.
        These communities usually produce tangentially related software
        (such as installation mechanisms), and provide support and documentation
        for their work.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Fun Fact:</h4>
        <p>
            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamos">SteamOS</a>
            is downstream of Debian 8.
        </p>
    </div>

       <p>
        When browsing for your next new operating system, you will often
        hear the term "downstream," which warrants some explanation.
        Since these projects are free software, it is permitted to
        copy, then modify it; in the case of
        Linux distributions, such a modification is called an <em>derivative,</em>
        and the modified software is said to be <em>downstream</em> of its
        source.
    </p>

    <p>
        For instance, <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> is downstream of
        Debian, and <a href="https://manjaro.org">Manjaro</a> is downstream of
        <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a>.
        Usually, these derivatives focus on quality-of-life
        improvements, and as a rule of thumb, you can trust free software.
    </p>

    <h2> Linux Mint </h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Mint is downstream of Ubuntu, so all remarks and examples 
            in this text apply to it as well.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        I like
        <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint,</a>
        but then, I'm a simple guy.
        Mint is a characteristically professional operating system,
        and focuses on productivity&mdash; that means you'll be up and
        running before you know it.
        It is extremely new-user friendly, and maintains the power
        of any other Unix-like operating system.
    </p>

    <p>
        New for Linux Mint 19 is <em>Timeshift.</em> From <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift">their github:</a>
        "Timeshift protects your system by taking incremental
        snapshots of the file system at regular intervals. These snapshots
        can be restored at a later date to undo all changes to the system."

        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            It has been said that one can spend a lifetime customizing
            Linux desktops.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Mint offers the Cinnamon desktop environment;
        Windows users will feel right at home.
        I find it to be an attractive desktop, but it's only moderately customizable.
        Like many users, I just want a desktop environment that stays out of my way,
        and Cinnamon does exactly that.
    </p>



    <p>
        Mint isn't perfect:  It tends to be boring.
        Changes from release to release are minor, and the software available from 
        Debian's
        repositories tends to be mature and stable, as opposed to new and unproven.
