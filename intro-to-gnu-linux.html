    <p>
      An operating system is a collection of software designed to facilitate
      the use of a computer.
      To this end, its two main responsibilities are to support running
      programs, known as processes, and to maintain persistent data, usually in the form of files.
      In addition, operating systems ease the task of creating
      useful programs (i.e., computer programming).
      Modern GNU/Linux offers the single best programming environment
      available today.

    <h2>Unix Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      GNU/Linux belongs to a large class of operating systems called
      <em>Unix-like</em>, sometimes referred to as <em>*nix</em>.
      The Unix operating system had a clear and well-documented architecture,
      which has been replicated many times in both open-source and proprietary contexts.
      A simplified depiction of its architecture is as follows:
    </p>

    <img src="assets/img/linux-architecture.png" style="height: 400px;">

    <p>
      <strong>Hardware:</strong>
      At the heart of any machine is its hardware.
      Each piece of hardware
      has a software interface defined by the engineers that
      created it.
      These interfaces are varied at best.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Drivers:</strong>
      Directly interacting with hardware and providing a more-uniform interface to
      each piece is the task of the system's <em>drivers</em>. This software layer
      represents the deepest and most remote element of any operating system.
      While drivers can be installed on an as-needed basis, in GNU/Linux
      the tendency is to include many drivers, and use only those that are required.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Kernel:</strong>
      While the heart of any machine is its hardware, the heart of any
      Unix-like operating system is its kernel.
      The kernel uses drivers to direct the actions of the machine, at the
      behest of processes.
      Because the expectations that we have for the system are great
      (running multiple programs concurrently, never losing files nor parts of
      files, weeks-long stability),
      this is a <em>large</em> and <em>involved</em> piece of software.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>System Calls:</strong>
      In order to permit interaction with the kernel, each
      Unix-like operating system employs a set of system calls.
      While the system-call interface is not the only means of interacting with
      the kernel, it is the most-used and most-traditional.
      From a source-code point of view, system calls "look" and "act" like ordinary function
      calls, but their actions are not restricted to user-space; rather, they
      transcend the software hierarchy, often making changes at the hardware level.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Processes:</strong>
      Sometimes called a "user-space process," a process is an executing program.
      On Unix-like systems, processes run the entire show, and
      are the only means that a user has to interact with the system.
      That is, processes are a critical component of a functioning Unix-like operating system.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content" id="linux-kernel">
      <h2>The Linux Kernel</h2>
      <p>
        Properly speaking, the name <em>Linux</em> refers only to the Linux Kernel.
        The Linux Kernel was began by Linus Torvalds in 1991, then a graduate student
        of the University of Helsinki.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">[1]</a></sup>
        Following the architecture of the Unix operating system,
        he wrote an open-source kernel as "...a hobby, won't be big and professional like
        [the GNU kernel]."<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-Torvlads25Aug91-17">[2]</a></sup>
        He soon released it publicly under the free-and-open-source <em>GNU General Public License, version 2.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Since then, the Linux kernel has become very successful, becoming
        the most-used Unix-like kernel in existence today.
        Demands on the kernel development process are great:
        It must facilitate change, so that new features may be incorporated;
        it must yield stable kernels, for private and commercial use; most
        importantly, it must accept patches from thousands of unknown and volunteer developers each month.
        As such, the development process is somewhat involved.
        See <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process?h=v5.8-rc1">The Kernel Development Process</a>
        for official information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Linus Torvalds remains the maintainer of the Development branch today.
        (One does not contact Linus Torvalds; this is here only because it is interesting.)
        Another major figure in Linux development is Greg Kroah-Hartman (pronounced "<em>Crow</em>-Hartman").
        He is currently the maintainer of the Stable branch.

      <h2>GNU</h2>
      <p>
        Development and deployment of Unix-like operating systems is
        contingent upon some user-space programs, such as a C compiler and
        an <em>sh</em>-compatible shell.
        GNU (pronounced <em>gah-new</em>) is well-known for producing high-quality, well-documented
        free software; they are as "official" as the open-source community gets.
      </p>

      <div class="aside-right">
        <h4> From <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">gnu.org:</a> </h4>
        <p>
          “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community.
          Roughly, it means that <strong>the users have the freedom to run, copy,
          distribute, study, change and improve the software.</strong>[sic]
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The GNU Project was began by Richard Stallman in September 1983,<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html">[2]</a></sup>
        and takes freedom very seriously.
        In GNU language, <em>free</em> software does not mean merely, "costs nothing."
        Rather, it is intended to mean <em>free as in
        freedom.</em><sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">[3]</a></sup>
        GNU and the open-source community often use
        the term <em>libre</em> to connote this kind of freedom.
        It should speak volumes that Linus Torvalds chose to release his budding
        kernel under a GNU license.
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>gcc</code> is the de-facto compiler on GNU/Linux operating
        systems.  It stands for <em>GNU Compiler Collection,</em> and is
        exclusively used to build Linux kernels.
        <code>bash</code> is the default shell on these systems; it also is maintained
        by the GNU project.
        Each tool offered by GNU is well-documented, so look to them for
        official documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        A point of note:
        The GNU project maintains a list of "free" operating systems on their website.
        Their criteria is extremely restrictive, disallowing non-free software to
        exist even in downloadable form on the distribution's package-management repositories.
        Most Linux distributions are not listed; this is permissiveness on the part
        of the distribution's maintainer, allowing non-free software to be
        officially supported, and does not mean that you can't use it.

<div id="distributions" class="content">
    <h2> Linux Distributions </h2>
    <p>
      A distribution is a collection of software that, when installed, yields
      a functioning operating system.
      Each will include a kernel, compiled with some drivers, core utilities,
      and, usually, some user-space applications (e.g., Firefox).
      All of this is tested to work and will be packaged in a fashion that facilitates installation
      (usually, an ISO).
    </p>

    <p>
      In my opinion, distributions are more similar than dissimilar;
      to me, they're more like flavors of the Unix architecture, rather than distinct operating systems.
      The oldest distribution that's still maintained is
      <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most distributions follow an incremental release cycle,
      in which versions of software are frozen, and only patched for security and bug fixes.
      The number of features that are included with software is a function of how new it is;
      on the other hand, newer software tends to have more bugs.
      As a consequence, each distribution is, in part, a compromise between
      features and stability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some distributions follow a "rolling release" development cycle&mdash; notably,
      <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux">Arch.</a>
      This method of delivering software focuses on obtaining and using the
      latest version of each.
      In particular, new package releases are expected to
      work correctly only with the latest package releases.
      The user is expected to update/upgrade frequently, but is guaranteed that
      each system-wide update will yield a coherent collection of software (in theory).
    </p>

    <p>
      New users are expected to "distro hop," changing between distributions
      frequently and nonsensically.
      The principle distinction between distributions at this phase is
      the desktop environment it ships with.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="mint" class="content">
    <h2> Linux Mint </h2>
    <p>
      I like <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint,</a> but then, I'm a simple guy.
      It's easy to install,  easy to use, is very professional and focuses on productivity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mint offers the Cinnamon desktop environment;
      Windows users will feel right at home.
      It's a decently attractive desktop, but only moderately customizable.
      Like many users, I just want to get to work, so a
      desktop environment that stays out of my way helps me do exactly that.
    </p>

    <p>
      New for Linux Mint 19 is <em>Timeshift.</em> From <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift">their github:</a>
      "Timeshift for Linux is an application that provides functionality
      similar to the <em>System Restore</em> feature in Windows and the <em>Time Machine</em>
      tool in Mac OS. Timeshift protects your system by taking incremental
      snapshots of the file system at regular intervals. These snapshots
      can be restored at a later date to undo all changes to the system."
    </p>

    <p>
      I recommend using it&mdash;  It's saved my butt a few times.
      You will be queried about it (and other optional things, such as a firewall)
      at the end of installation.
      Make sure you walk through the <a href="https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">installation instructions.</a>
