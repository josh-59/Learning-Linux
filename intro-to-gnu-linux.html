        An operating system is a collection of software designed to facilitate
        the use of a computer.
        To this end, its two main responsibilities are to support running
        programs, known as processes, and to maintain persistent
        data, in the form of files.
        In addition, operating systems ease the task of creating
        useful programs by offering programmers a predictable environment.
        Modern, open-source GNU/Linux offers the single best programming environment
        available today.

    <h2>UNIX</h2>
    <p>
        The Unix Operating System was born in late 1969 at Bell Labs, in the shadow
        of <a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">Multics</a> (Kernighan, 2020, pp. 31-34).
        Multics was an operating system intended to
        commercialize computing by offering it as a service, similar to telephone or
        electricity.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">cd Pubcd</a></sup>
        Users would connnect their <a href="text-terminals.html">text terminals</a>
        to a central mainframe, then pay for computation on an as-used basis.
    </p>

    <p>
        Being a joint venture between MIT, AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories, and General
        Electric, Multics was a large and, in many ways, novel, project.
        It introduced many new operating systems ideas&mdash; among them,
        the hierarchical
        file structure.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">[1]</a></sup>
        For a variety of reasons, the project never realized its dream, and in 1969
        Bell Labs abandoned it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within Bell Labs, management put operating systems research on
        the backburner, and refused to purchase new computing
        equipment.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
        After finding a disused and underpowered <a href="https://www.soemtron.org/pdp7.html">PDP-7</a>,
        Ken Thompson rewrote <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Travel_(video_game)">Space Travel</a></em> for
        it.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
        In the process, he accrued the tools and skills necessary to implement
        a filesystem he and others at Bell Laboratories had been devising on paper.<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        At some point in 1969, Ken Thompson realized that he was three weeks
        from an operating system.  All he needed was an
        <em>exec</em> call, an assembler, a text editor and a shell.
        In 1970, the new operating system was christened <em>UNIX,</em>
        as a "somewhat treacherous pun on
        MULTICS."<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Owing in part to the restrictive nature of available
        hardware, the budding operating system focused
        on simplicity.<sup><a href="http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf">[4]</a></sup>
        In addition, early computer researchers were programmers as well as users,
        so that their operating system facilitated programming as a means of use.
        This theme has been echoed throughout Linux's history, and is a
        key to understanding its success.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside</h4>
        <p>
            The performance penalty implied by rewriting the kernel in C
            has been estimated at 20-30% over assembly.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The earliest versions of the new operating system were put to use
        internally by Bell Labs to assist in patent
        applications.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
        The software then moved away from its nest under obtuse licenses to
        universities, where its code, though not free, was studied and documented.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
        Finally, Unix became commercially available, to principally
        to corporate clients.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1973, after Dennis Ritchie introduced <em>struct</em>'s to the C programming language,
        Ken Thompson was able to rewrite most of Unix in C (Kerninghan, p. 78);
        this corresponded to <em>UNIX Version 6.</em>
        This rewrite is especially important to the history of
        computing because it spawned the notion of <em>portability</em>:
        The same software, written in a high-level language, can be
        compiled to run on different machines.
        By 1978, Unix was running on several different architectures (Kernighan, p. 140).

    <h2>The Unix Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        Unix spawned a large class of operating systems called
        <em>Unix-like,</em> sometimes referred to as <em>*nix.</em>
        Unix had a clear and well-documented architecture;
        its derivatives share this architecture, in addition to the Unix philosophy.
        An overview of its architecture is as follows:
    </p>

    <img src="assets/img/linux-architecture.png" style="height: 400px;">

    <p>
        <strong>Hardware:</strong>
        At the heart of any machine is its hardware.
        Each piece of hardware has a software interface defined by the engineers that
        created it.
        These interfaces are varied at best.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Drivers:</strong>
        These interact directly with hardware and provide the kernel with
        a more-uniform interface to each piece. This software layer
        represents the deepest and most remote element of any operating system.
        Although drivers can be installed on an as-needed basis, in GNU/Linux
        the tendency is to include many drivers, and use only those that are required.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Kernel:</strong>
        While the heart of any machine is its hardware, the heart of any
        Unix-like operating system is its kernel.
        The kernel uses drivers to direct the actions of the machine, at the
        behest of processes.
        At some 28 million lines of code, this is a large and involved piece of software.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>System Calls:</strong>
        In order to permit interaction with the kernel, operating systems
        employ a set of system calls.
        From a source-code point of view, system calls "look" and "act" like ordinary function
        calls, but their actions are not restricted to user-space.  Rather, they
        transcend the software hierarchy, often propogating changes at the hardware level.
        Unix-like operating systems have six central system calls:
        <em>fork, exec, open, close, read,</em> and <em>write.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Processes:</strong>
        Sometimes called "user-space processes," a process is an executing
        program.
        On *nix platforms, processes run the entire show.
        They are the only means that a user has to interact with the system, and
        the kernel depends on them to direct its actions.
        Processes are a critical component of a functioning operating system.

    <h2>GNU</h2>
    <p>
        The first serious attempt at producing a free and open-source Unix-like
        operating system
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.en.html#f1">was announced</a> by Richard Stallman in 1983.
        Stallman was, at the time, a graduate student at
        MIT's AI Laboratory,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#Harvard_University_and_MIT">[5]</a></sup>
        and his project was called "GNU," a recursive acronym for <em>GNU's Not Unix.</em><sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html">[6]</a></sup>
    </p>


    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4> From <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">gnu.org</a>:</h4>
        <p>
            “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community.
            Roughly, it means that <strong>the users have the freedom to run, copy,
            distribute, study, change and improve the software.</strong>[sic]
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        To create an entire operating system is an enormous task, but,
        "...by 1990 [the GNU Project] had either found or written all the major components except one&ndash; the kernel."<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html">[6]</a></sup>
        GNU's own kernel, dubbed <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/">Hurd</a>,
        is, as of 2020, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/news/2016-12-18-releases.html">in version 0.9</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, the GNU Project is well-regarded for producing high-quality, well-documented
        free software;
        they are as "official" as the open-source community gets.
    </p>

    <p>
        In particular, GNU's compiler collection, <code>gcc</code>, contains the de-facto C compiler
        of the open-source community.
        This compiler is the only one capable of building Linux kernels.<sup><a href="http://files.kroah.com/lkn/lkn_pdf/ch02.pdf">[7]</a></sup>
        Similarly, their <code>Bash</code> shell is the default shell on many distributions.
    </p>

    <p>
        The GNU Project takes freedom very seriously.
        In their language, <em>free</em> does not mean merely, "costs nothing."
        Rather, it means <em>free as in
            freedom.</em><sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">[8]</a></sup>
            Thus, GNU's software is free in terms of both price and liberty;
            the open-source community sometimes uses
            the term <em>libre</em> to connote this kind of freedom.

    <h2>The Linux Kernel </h2>

    <p>
        On August 25, 1991, a Finnish graduate student by the name of Linus Torvalds
        announced his own free operating system project.
        Again following the architecture of the Unix operating system,
        his project was intended to be "...just a hobby, won't be big and
        professional like gnu<sup>[sic]</sup>."<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[9]</a></sup>
        He soon released it under the GNU General Public License, Version 2.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-left" style="font-size: 11pt;">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Properly speaking, the name <em>Linux</em> refers only to the Linux kernel.
        </p>
    </div>


    <p>
        While the GNU Project ambitiously intended to
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.en.html#f1">produce an entire operating system</a>, Linus restricted his
        attention to creating a kernel.
        By October, he had Bash, GCC, GNU-Make and other
        programs running on his creation.<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[9]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Moreover, while GNU sought professionalism and officiality,
        Linux was, "...meant for hackers interested in operating systems
        and 386's."<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[9]</a></sup>
        Interest in the Linux kernel flourished, in large part because
        of the informality of the project:  Everybody was invited, if only
        to tinker with it.
        It has since become the most successful Unix-like kernel in existence.

        Today, Linus Torvalds remains the maintainer of the Development branch.
        Another major figure in Linux development is Greg Kroah-Hartman (pronounced "<em>Crow</em>-Hartman"), who is the maintainer of the Stable branch.

        Although development of Linux began as a hobby, it is an occupation

            </li>


            <li>
                HP's <em>UX</em>
            </li>

            <li>
                SCO's <em>Xenix</em>
                <p>
                    Originally created by Microsoft, Xenix was sold to
                    <em>Santa Cruz Operations</em> in 198x after Microsoft
                    signed a deal with IBM to produce ____ (DOS).
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        The lack of uniformity among them caused difficulties in creating
        portable software
        could be transported from one system to another.

        In 1988 IEEE released the first POSIX standard.

        Today, the standard effectively codifies what it means to be "Unix-like."
    -->

    <p>
        The system calls that an operating system provides
        determine the interface that any user-space process has
        to the operating system, and thus to the machine.
        In order to assure software portability across operating systems, it is
        essential that this interface be (mostly) uniform.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Richard Stallman suggested the name <em>POSIX.</em>
            It is pronounced <em>pahz-icks.</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The first <em>Portable Operating System Interface</em> specification
        was released as an IEEE standard in 1988,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#Name">[12]</a></sup>
        and specified the system-call interface available to user-space programs,
        among other things.
        Operating systems that abide by this standard are called <em>POSIX Compliant;</em>
        systems developers general aim for POSIX compliance.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">[13]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Posix has been refined since 1988.
        In addition, a stronger specification has been introduced, and is
        called the <em>Single Unix Specification.</em><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">[13]</a></sup>
        Certification to this standard is costly, and it is generally reserved for proprietary operating systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        While the system-call interface is not the only means of interacting with
        the kernel, and properly speaking belongs to the kernel,
        I feel it a sufficiently important abstraction layer to be depicted separately:
        Most interactions between processes and the operating system occur
        through the system-call interface.

    <h2> Linux Distributions </h2>
    <p>
        A Linux distribution is a collection of software that, when installed, yields
        a functioning operating system.
        Each includes a kernel, some core utilities,
        and, usually, some user-space applications (e.g., Firefox).
        All of this is tested to work and will be packaged in a fashion that facilitates installation,
        (usually, an ISO).
    </p>

    <p>
        In my opinion, distributions are more similar than dissimilar.
        Think of them as flavors of the Unix architecture, rather than distinct operating systems.
        The oldest distribution that's still maintained is
        <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a>, first released
        in 1993.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware">[14]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the key distinctions between distributions is the package management
        system that is provided.
        The package-management system is intended to be the user's interface
        to obtaining, installing and upgrading software; it's similar
        to a <em>Store</em> on closed-source OS's.
        While the user is free to install software "by hand," this is generally
        discouraged because the package-management system allows centralized
        and automated updating.
    </p>

    <p>
        Distributions differ in philosophy towards the software that's appropriate
        to their operating system.
        Loosely, newer software has newer features, but
        is less stable than older software.
        For an operating system intended to be used on a server (e.g., <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>),
        the maintainers would tend towards reliable, stable,
        and well-tested user-space software.
        Similarly, a distribution geared towards development
        (e.g., <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a>) would employ software which is newer and less-tested.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some distributions follow a "rolling release" development cycle&mdash; notably,
        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux">Arch.</a>
        This method of delivering software focuses on obtaining and using the
        latest version of each.
        Under the rolling release paradigm, new software releases are expected to
        work correctly only with the latest software releases.
        The user is expected to update/upgrade frequently, but is guaranteed that
        each system-wide update will yield a coherent collection of software.

    <h2> Linux Mint </h2>
    <p>
        I like <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint,</a> but then, I'm a simple guy.
        This distribution is downstream of Debian, which means that
        it's a derivative of Debian.
        It inherits their package-management tool, <code>apt</code>,
        and also Debain's philosophy towards software.
        Linux Mint is a characteristically professional operating system, and focuses on
        productivity.  It is extremely new-user friendly, but retains the power
        of any other Unix-like operating system.

    <p>
        Mint offers the Cinnamon desktop environment;
        Windows users will feel right at home.
        I find it to be an attractive desktop, but it's only moderately customizable.
        Like many users, I just want to get to work, so a
        desktop environment that stays out of my way helps me do exactly that.
    </p>

    <p>
        New for Linux Mint 19 is <em>Timeshift.</em> From <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift">their github:</a>
        "Timeshift for Linux is an application that provides functionality
        similar to the <em>System Restore</em> feature in Windows and the <em>Time Machine</em>
        tool in Mac OS. Timeshift protects your system by taking incremental
        snapshots of the file system at regular intervals. These snapshots
        can be restored at a later date to undo all changes to the system."
    </p>

    <p>
        Mint isn't perfect:  It isn't new and isn't flashy.
        Changes from release to release are minor, and the software available from Debian's
        <code>apt</code> is comparatively old.
        But, it is very stable and very predictable.
        Linux Mint 20 is a long-term support
        release, and <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3928">will be supported until 2025</a>.
