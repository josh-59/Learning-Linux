        An operating system is a collection of software designed to facilitate
        the use of a computer.
        To this end, its two main responsibilities are to support running
        programs, known as processes, and to maintain persistent
        data, in the form of files.
        In addition, operating systems ease the task of creating
        useful programs by offering programmers a predictable environment.
        Modern, open-source GNU/Linux offers the single best programming environment
        available today.

    <h2>UNIX</h2>
    <p>
        The Unix Operating System was born in late 1969 at Bell Labs, in the shadow
        of <a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">Multics</a>.
        Multics was an operating system intended to
        commercialize computing by offering it as a service, similar to telephone or
        electricity.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">[1]</a></sup>
        Users would connnect their <a href="text-terminals.html">text terminals</a>
        to a central mainframe, then pay for computation on an as-used basis.
    </p>

    <p>
        Being a joint venture between MIT, AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories, and General
        Electric, Multics was a large and, in many ways, novel, project.
        It introduced many new operating systems ideas&mdash; among them,
        the hierarchical
        file structure.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">[1]</a></sup>
        For a variety of reasons, the project never realized its dream, and in 1969
        Bell Labs abandoned it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within Bell Labs, management put operating systems research on
        the backburner, and refused to purchase new computing
        equipment.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
        After finding a disused and underpowered <a href="https://www.soemtron.org/pdp7.html">PDP-7</a>,
        Ken Thompson rewrote <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Travel_(video_game)">Space Travel</a></em> for
        it.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
        In the process, he accrued the tools and skills necessary to implement
        a filesystem he and others at Bell Laboratories had been devising on paper.<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        At some point in 1969, Ken Thompson realized that he was three weeks
        from an operating system.  All he needed was an
        <em>exec</em> call, an assembler, a text editor and a shell.
        In 1970, the new operating system was christened <em>UNIX,</em>
        as a "somewhat treacherous pun on
        MULTICS."<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Owing in part to the restrictive nature of available
        hardware, the budding operating system focused
        on simplicity.<sup><a href="http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf">[4]</a></sup>
        In addition, early computer researchers were programmers as well as users,
        so that their operating system facilitated programming as a means of use.
        This theme has been echoed throughout Linux's history, and is a
        key to understanding its success.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside</h4>
        <p>
            The performance penalty implied by rewriting the kernel in C
            has been estimated at 20-30% over assembly.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The earliest versions of the new operating system were put to use
        internally by Bell Labs to assist in patent
        applications.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
        The software then moved away from its nest under obtuse licenses to
        universities, where its code, though not free, was studied and documented.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
        Finally, Unix became commercially available, to principally
        to corporate clients.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1973, after Dennis Ritchie introduced <em>struct</em>'s to the C programming language,
        Ken Thompson was able to rewrite most of Unix in C (Kerninghan, p. 78);
        this corresponded to <em>UNIX Version 6.</em>
        This rewrite is especially important to the history of
        computing because it spawned the notion of <em>portability</em>:
        The same software, written in a high-level language, can be
        compiled to run on different machines.
        By 1978, Unix was running on several different architectures (Kernighan, p. 140).

    <h2>The Unix Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        Unix had a simple, clear and well-documented architecture
        that
        <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Unix_history-simple.svg">inspired many operating systems</a>, including GNU/Linux.
        It is organized as a heirarchy of layers:
        Each layer builds upon the one beneathe it, and supports
        the layer immediately above it.
    </p>

    <img src="assets/img/linux-architecture.png" style="height: 400px;">

    <p>
        <strong>Hardware:</strong>
        At the heart of any machine is its hardware.
        Each piece of hardware has a software interface defined by the
        engineering team that created it.
        These interfaces are varied at best.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Drivers:</strong>
        Drivers interact with hardware, and provide the kernel with
        a more-uniform interface to each piece.
        This software layer
        represents the deepest and most remote element of any operating system.
        Although drivers can be installed on an as-needed basis, in GNU/Linux
        the tendency is to include many drivers, and use only those that are required.
        Drivers are not usually written by the hardware's engineers or vendors.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Kernel:</strong>
        While the heart of any machine is its hardware, the heart any
        Unix-like operating system is its kernel.
        The kernel is a large and involved piece of software, responsible for
        scheduling the CPU, allotting memory, supporting running programs
        and maintaining file integrity.
        In a non-trivial sense, it is the "brains" behind the operation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>System Calls:</strong>
        The operations that the kernel can undertake are, classically,
        defined by the system calls it supports.
        Unix-like operating systems have six essential system calls:
        <em>fork, exec, open, close, read,</em> and
        <em>write.</em><sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
        Both <em>fork</em> and <em>exec</em> are concerned with processes,
        while <em>open, close, read,</em> and <em>write</em> are concerned with
        files.
        These effectively permit interaction with the kernel, and it is
        often useful to know how the kernel responds to system calls.
        However, processes cannot dictate how the kernel carries system calls out;
        in fact, the kernel may deny a system call (if, say, a file does not
        exist, or the calling process does not have appropriate authority).
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Processes:</strong>
        A process, sometimes called a "user-space process" or "user-land process,"
        is an executing program.
        Within Unix and other Unix-like operating systems, processes run the entire show:
        The kernel is entirely, and deliberately, dependant upon processes
        to tell it what to do.
        It follows that there must exist at least one "trusted" process within
        user-land, to get other processes on their feet&mdash;
        and this is in-fact exactly the case.
        At a deep level, this is one of the more beautiful elements of the
        Unix architecture.

    <h2>GNU</h2>
    <p>
        The first serious attempt at producing a free and open-source Unix-like
        operating system
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.en.html#f1">was announced</a> by Richard Stallman in 1983.
        Stallman was, at the time, a graduate student at
        MIT's AI Laboratory,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#Harvard_University_and_MIT">[6]</a></sup>
        and his project was called "GNU," a recursive acronym for <em>GNU's Not Unix.</em><sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html">[7]</a></sup>
    </p>


    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4> From <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">gnu.org</a>:</h4>
        <p>
            “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community.
            Roughly, it means that <strong>the users have the freedom to run, copy,
            distribute, study, change and improve the software.</strong>[sic]
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        To create an entire operating system is an enormous task, but,
        seven years later, the GNU Project had
        either found or written all major components except one&ndash; the kernel.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html">[7]</a></sup>
        GNU's own kernel, dubbed <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/">Hurd</a>, has not been completed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, the GNU Project is well-regarded for producing high-quality, well-documented
        free software;
        they are as "official" as the open-source community gets.
        In particular, GNU's compiler collection,
        <code><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org">gcc</a></code>, contains the de-facto C compiler
        of the open-source community.
        This compiler is the only one capable of building Linux kernels.<sup><a href="http://files.kroah.com/lkn/lkn_pdf/ch02.pdf">[8]</a></sup>
        Similarly, their shell,
        <code><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a></code>
        is the default shell on many distributions.
    </p>

    <p>
        The GNU Project takes freedom very seriously.
        In their language, <em>free</em> does not mean merely, "costs nothing."
        Rather, it means <em>free as in
            freedom.</em><sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">[9]</a></sup>
        Like freedom of speech,
        GNU's software is free in terms of both price and liberty;
        the open-source community sometimes uses
        the term <em>libre</em> to connote this kind of freedom.

    <h2>The Linux Kernel </h2>

    <p>
        On August 25, 1991, a Finnish graduate student by the name of Linus Torvalds
        announced his own free operating system project.
        Again following the architecture of the Unix operating system,
        his project was intended to be "...just a hobby, won't be big and
        professional like GNU."<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[10]</a></sup>
        He soon released it under the GNU General Public License, Version 2.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right" style="font-size: 11pt;">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Properly speaking, the name <em>Linux</em> refers only to the Linux kernel.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        While the GNU Project ambitiously intended to
        produce an entire operating system, Linus restricted his
        attention to creating a kernel.
        By October, he had GNU's Bash, GCC, Make and other
        programs running on his creation.<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[10]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Linus Torvalds became interested in operating systems after
            finding an error in the source code of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL">Sinclair QL's</a> QDOS.
            <sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Interest in the kernel flourished, in large part because
        of the informality of the project:  Everybody was invited, if only
        to tinker with it.
        It has since become the most successful Unix-like kernel in existence,
        and accounts for fully half of the "GNU/Linux" namesake.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/2.Process.html?highlight=merge window">kernel development process</a>
        has become more structured since 1991, and today uses a
        "<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/programming-in-nix.html#train-schedules">train-schedule</a>" approach.
        Linus Torvalds remains the maintainer of the Development branch,
        and often remarks upon the kernel's latest releases.
    </p>

    <p>
        A major figure of modern Linux development is Greg Kroah-Hartman (pronounced "<em>Crow</em>-Hartman"), who is the maintainer of the Stable branch
        and several subsystems.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kroah-Hartman">[11]</a></sup>
        According to Mr. Kroah-Hartman, interest in the kernel continues to
        grow, with 1200 new developers joining the project each
        year.<sup><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/26/linux_kernel_intel/">[12]</a></sup>
        Moreover, their main development bottlenecks are code review and
        maintainership.<sup><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/26/linux_kernel_intel/">[12]</a></sup>

        Although development of Linux began as a hobby, it is an occupation
        for some, and serious affair for many.
        In particular, the kernel development team
        takes great care not to break
        user-space,<sup><a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75">[13]</a></sup>
        meaning that programs that <em>did</em> work will continue to
        work.
        In this way, they ensure the long-term stability of Linux-based
        platforms.<sup><a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/235335/why-is-there-a-linux-kernel-policy-to-never-break-user-space">[14]</a></sup>

<div id="distributions" class="content">
    <h2> Linux Distributions </h2>
    <p>
        A Linux distribution is a collection of software that, when installed, yields
        a functioning operating system.
        Each includes some variant of the Linux kernel, some core utilities,
        and, usually, some user-space applications (e.g., Firefox).
        All of this is tested to work and packaged in a fashion that
        facilitates installation (usually, an ISO disk image).
    </p>

    <p>
        In my opinion, distributions are more similar than dissimilar.
        Think of them as flavors of the Unix architecture, rather than
        incompatible operating systems.
        The oldest distribution that's still maintained is
        <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a>, first released
        in 1993.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware">[17]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Almost always, a distribution becomes a project, around which
        a community forms.
        These communities usually produce tangentially related software
        (such as installation mechanisms), and provide support and documentation
        for their work.
    </p>

    <p>
        These communities often differ in the precise goals for their work.
        For instance, the <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> project
        intends to produce a stable operating system appropriate for use in
        servers, while the <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a> project
        intends to stay closer to the cutting edge, and is willing to
        sacrifice some stability to do so.
    </p>

    <p>
        When browsing for your next new operating system, you will often
        hear the term "downstream," which warrants some explanation.
        Since these projects are free software, it is permitted to
        copy, then modify it; in the case of
        Linux distributions, such a modification is called an <em>derivative,</em>
        and the modified software is said to be <em>downstream</em> of the old
        software.
    </p>

    <p>
        For instance, <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> is downstream of
        Debian, and <a href="https://manjaro.org">Manjaro</a> is downstream of
        Arch.
        Usually, these derivatives focus on superficial and quality-of-life
        improvements, and as a rule of thumb, you can trust free software.

    <h2> Linux Mint </h2>
    <p>
        My favorite Linux distribution is
        <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint,</a>
        but then, I'm a simple guy.
        This distribution is actually downstream of Ubuntu, although
        they do offer a version that is a first-order derivative of Debian
        (which I prefer).
        Either way, Mint inherits Debain's philosophy towards software, meaning
        that it focuses on stability.

        Linux Mint is a characteristically professional operating system,
        and focuses on productivity&mdash; that means that you'll be up and
        running before you know it.
        It is extremely new-user friendly, and maintains the power
        of any other Unix-like operating system.

        Mint offers the Cinnamon desktop environment;
        Windows users will feel right at home.
        I find it to be an attractive desktop, but it's only moderately customizable.
        Like many users, I just want to get to work, so a
        desktop environment that stays out of my way helps me do exactly that.

        New for Linux Mint 19 is <em>Timeshift.</em> From <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift">their github:</a>
        "Timeshift for Linux is an application that provides functionality
        similar to the <em>System Restore</em> feature in Windows and the <em>Time Machine</em>
        tool in Mac OS. Timeshift protects your system by taking incremental
        snapshots of the file system at regular intervals. These snapshots
        can be restored at a later date to undo all changes to the system."

    <p>
        Mint isn't perfect:  It isn't new and isn't flashy.
        Changes from release to release are minor, and the software available from Debian's
        <code>apt</code> is comparatively old.
        But, it is very stable and very predictable.
        Linux Mint 20 <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3928">will be supported until 2025</a>.
