      An operating system is a collection of software designed to facilitate
      the use of a computer.
      To this end, its two main responsibilities are to support running
      programs, known as processes, and to maintain persistent data, usually in the form of files.
      In addition, operating systems ease the task of creating
      useful programs (i.e., computer programming).
      Modern GNU/Linux offers the single best programming environment
      available today.

    <h2>Unix Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      GNU/Linux belongs to a large class of operating systems called
      <em>Unix-like</em>, sometimes referred to as <em>*nix</em>.
      The Unix operating system had a clear and well-documented architecture,
      which has been replicated many times in both open-source and proprietary contexts.
      A simplified depiction of its architecture is as follows:
    </p>

    <img src="assets/img/linux-architecture.png" style="height: 400px;">

    <p>
      <strong>Hardware:</strong>
      At the heart of any machine is its hardware.
      Each piece of hardware
      has a software interface defined by the engineers that
      created it.
      These interfaces are varied at best.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Drivers:</strong>
      Directly interacting with hardware and providing a more-uniform interface to
      each piece is the task of the system's <em>drivers</em>. This software layer
      represents the deepest and most remote element of any operating system.
      While drivers can be installed on an as-needed basis, in GNU/Linux
      the tendency is to include many drivers, and use only those that are required.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Kernel:</strong>
      While the heart of any machine is its hardware, the heart of any
      Unix-like operating system is its kernel.
      The kernel uses drivers to direct the actions of the machine, at the
      behest of processes.
      Because the expectations that we have for the system are great
      (running multiple programs concurrently, never losing files nor parts of
      files, weeks-long stability),
      this is a <em>large</em> and <em>involved</em> piece of software.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>System Calls:</strong>
      In order to permit interaction with the kernel, each
      Unix-like operating system employs a set of system calls.
      From a source-code point of view, these "look" and "act" like ordinary function
      calls, but their actions are not restricted to user-space; rather, they
      transcend the software hierarchy, often making changes at the hardware level.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Processes:</strong>
      Sometimes called a "user-space process," a process is an executing program.
      On Unix-like systems, processes run the entire show, and
      are the only means that a user has to interact with the system.
      That is, processes are a critical component of a functioning Unix-like operating system.
    </p>

      <h2>The Linux Kernel</h2>
      <p>
        Properly speaking, the name <em>Linux</em> refers only to the Linux Kernel.
        The Linux Kernel was began by Linus Torvalds in 1991, then a graduate student
        of the University of Helsinki.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">[1]</a></sup>
        Following the architecture of the Unix operating system,
        he wrote an open-source kernel as "...a hobby, won't be big and professional like
        [the GNU kernel]."<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-Torvlads25Aug91-17">[2]</a></sup>
        He soon released it publicly under the free-and-open-source <em>GNU General Public License, version 2.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Since then, the Linux kernel has become very successful, being both
        widely used and attracting many developers.
        Demands on the development process are great:
        It must both facilitate change, so that new features may be incorporated,
        and also yield stable kernels, for private and commercial use.
        As such, the development process is somewhat involved; see
        <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process?h=v5.8-rc1">The Kernel Development Process</a>
        for official information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Linus Torvalds remains the maintainer of the Development branch today.
        (One does not contact Linus Torvalds; this is here only because it is interesting.)
        Another major figure in Linux development is Greg Kroah-Hartman (pronounced "<em>Crow</em>-Hartman").
        He is currently the maintainer of the Stable branch.

      <h2>GNU</h2>

      The deployment of a Unix-like operating system is contingent upon
      the execution of some user-space programs.
    </div>

    <div class="content" id="posix">
      <h2> Specifications </h2>


    <p>
        - System Call API
        - Standard "Core" utilities


      System Call API:
      The operating system exposes a system call interface to each
      user-space process, allowing a process to instruct the kernel to carry out
      actions on its behalf.
        - POSIX / SUSv4
        - #?


      The kernel is the software layer between user-space programs and hardware drivers.


      A great number of kernels implement the Unix system-call API,

      "Core" Utilites:
      The standard collection of programs that help define the working "Linux" OS;
      Some of these are critical to operating system functionality (?? Examples ??)
        - GNU


      Bundling It All Up: The Distribution
        An operating system, precompiled for use.
        It includes a kernel, selected drivers, and selected utilities.

        Because Linux is open-source, it's relatively easy to produce your own distribution,
        and because it's free, anyone can do it.
