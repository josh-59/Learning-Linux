Linux Mint:
    <h3>Other Debian-based Distributions</h3>
    
    <p>
        When an example operating system is required in this book, 
        Linux Mint will be used, but similar remarks apply to 
        any Debian-based distribution (including Debian itself).
        Other popular Debian-based distributions include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="">Elementary OS</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Pop!_OS</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://zorinos.com/">ZorinOS</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Ubuntu</a> (Large Community)</li>
        <li><a href=""MX Linux</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pureos.net/">PureOS</a> (FSF-Certified "Free")</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Slackware and Debian are not the only non-derivate distributions 
        of our time.
        There is also <a href="">Fedora</a>, <a href="">Gentoo</a>,
        <a href="">openSUSE</a>, <a href="">Arch</a>, and <a href="">Red Hat
        Enterprise Linux</a>, just to name a few.
    </p>

    <p>
        I recommend Linux Mint as newcomers' first distribution, because
        everything <em>simply works.</em>
        No configuration is required. 
        Upon installation, the user is presented
        with a complete desktop, including backup schemes, audio/video codecs, 
        proprietary drivers, and a development environment.
        I use it because one can "get in it and go."
    </p>

    <p>
        In my opinion, Linux Mint has not taken its beginner-centricism far enough:
        It should be the zero-maintenance desktop.  
        It should, for example:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Choose the appropriate driver for the user upon installation
            (Hint: If you have a nvidia GPU, you want the nvidia driver)
        </li>
        <li>
            Automatically update (by default)
        </li>
        <li>
            Restart once a week (by default)
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Linux Mint should be the desktop that no-one cares about, and it should be 
        <em>really good</em> at it&mdash; emminently appropriate for workstations,
        schools, etc..
        But that's just, like, my opinion.

        Newcomers to Linux are often befuddled by the sheer number of options
        available to them.

        Which one is best for your purposes?
        Which one is best, period?

    <p>
        Let's back up a little:
        Each includes some version of the Linux kernel, GNU core utilities,
        and a desktop environment.
        As we'll see, distributions are characterized by their package managment,
        and in practice, the differences between them are suffiently superficial that the
        question becomes one of "experience."

        An operating system is a collection of software which facilitates
        the use of a computer.
        To this end, its two main responsibilities are to support running
        programs, called processes, and to maintain persistent
        data, in the form of files.
        In addition, operating systems ease the task of creating
        useful programs by offering programmers a logical architecture
        and predictable environment.
        Free and open source GNU/Linux has evolved to offer the single best
        programming environment available today.

    <h2>UNIX: A Brief History</h2>

    <p>
        The UNIX operating system was born in late 1969 at AT&amp;T's
        <em>Bell Laboratories,</em> in the shadow
        of Multics.
        Multics was an operating system intended to
        commercialize computing by offering it as a service, similar to telephone or
        electricity.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">[1]</a></sup>
        The intent was for users to connect <a href="terminals-and-shells.html">terminals</a>
        to a central mainframe, then pay for computation on an as-used basis.
        For a variety of reasons, the project never realized its dream, and in 1969
        AT&amp;T abandoned it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within Bell Labs, management put operating systems research on
        the backburner, and refused to purchase new computing
        equipment.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#references">[3]</a></sup>
        After finding a disused <a href="https://www.soemtron.org/pdp7.html">PDP-7</a>,
        Kenneth Thompson and Dennis Ritchie rewrote <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Travel_(video_game)">Space Travel</a></em> for it;
        after, Thompson continued to work with the PDP-7, implementing a
        filesystem he and others at Bell Laboratories had been
        devising on paper.<sup><a href="http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        At some point in 1969, while working on this filesystem,
        Thompson realized that he was very close to
        an operating system:  All he needed was an
        assembler, a text editor, a shell and an <em>exec</em> system call.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
        The <em>exec</em> call was "trivial", and the other three components were
        done in one week each.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        About his colleague's work, Dennis Ritchie said,
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Thompson wanted to create a comfortable computing environment
        constructed according to his own design, using whatever means were
        available. His plans, it is evident in retrospect, incorporated many
        of the innovative aspects of Multics, including an explicit notion of
        a process as a locus of control, a tree-structured file system, a
        command interpreter as user-level program, simple representation of
        text files, and generalized access to devices.<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html">[4]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The new operating system soon became a communal affair, and
        in 1970 was christened <em>UNIX,</em>
        as a "somewhat treacherous pun on
        MULTICS."<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a><a href="http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[3]</a></sup>
        The earliest versions were put to use
        internally by Bell Labs to assist in word processing and patent
        applications.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a><a href="#references">[3]</a></sup>
        The software then moved away from its nest under obtuse licenses to
        universities, where its source code, though not free, was studied and documented.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
        Finally, UNIX became commercially available, to principally
        corporate clients.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>

    <h2>The UNIX Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        UNIX had a clear, simple, and well-documented architecture
        that
        <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Unix_history-simple.svg">inspired many operating systems</a>, including GNU/Linux.
        It is organized as a heirarchy of layers;
        each layer builds upon the one beneathe it, and supports
        the layer immediately above it.
    </p>

    <img src="assets/img/linux-architecture.png" style="height: 400px;">

    <p>
        <strong>Hardware:</strong>
        A computer's hardware can be likened to its body.
        Each piece of hardware has a software interface defined by the
        engineers that created it; these interfaces are varied at best.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Drivers:</strong>
        Drivers interact with hardware, and simplify the interface between
        kernel and hardware.
        This software represents the deepest and most remote element
        of any operating system, and
        the abstraction layer it offers allows a single kernel
        to run on a variety of machines.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Kernel:</strong>
        The heart of any UNIX-like operating system is its kernel.
        The kernel is responsible for
        supporting running programs,
        scheduling the CPU,
        allotting memory, and
        maintaining file integrity, in addition to many other tasks.
        It is a large and involved piece of software, and can be likened
        to the "brains" of the operation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>System Calls:</strong>
        The set of operations that the kernel can undertake is
        defined by the system calls it supports.
        UNIX-like operating systems have six essential system calls:
        <em>fork, exec, open, close, read,</em> and
        <em>write.</em><sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
        Both <em>fork</em> and <em>exec</em> are concerned with launching
        programs, while <em>open, close, read,</em> and <em>write</em>
        constitute the essential interactions a process can have with files.
        Processes cannot dictate how the kernel carries these operations out,
        and in fact, the kernel may deny one if, for instance,
        a file does not exist, or the calling process does not have
        appropriate authority.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Processes:</strong>
        A <em>process,</em> sometimes called a "user-space process,"
        is an executing program.
        Within UNIX and like operating systems, processes run the show:
        The kernel is entirely dependant upon processes to tell it what to do,
        and so has no "mind" of its own.

        <center>Richard Stallman</center>
    </div>

    <p>
        The first attempt at producing a deliberately free and open-source
        UNIX clone was
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.en.html#f1">announced</a> by Richard Stallman in 1983.
        Stallman had been working at MIT's AI Laboratory for over a decade,
        and had grown accustomed to its culture of sharing source code:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="width: 55%;">
        "If you saw someone using an unfamiliar and interesting program, you
        could always ask to see the source code, so that you could read it, change
        it, or cannibalize parts of it to make a new
        program."<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">[6]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        In 1981, that culture collapsed as
        commercial ventures hired away most of the
        lab.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">[6]</a><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch07.html">[7]</a></sup>
        In 1982, when administrators purchased a new PDP-10, they opted for a
        closed-source, proprietary operating system, and indirectly threatened
        to seal the fate of software freedom.
        Stallman began to consider the merits of sharing software in
        itself,
        in the process deriving an analogy to scientific cooperation, a pillar of
        the University's  morals.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-programs-should-be-shared.html">[8]</a><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/yes-give-it-away.html">[9]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet, proprietary software was becoming the norm, with students working
        on projects intended for profit<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-programs-should-be-shared.html">[8]</a></sup>
        and companies going so far as to require
        nondisclosure agreements be signed to get an
        executable.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">[6]</a></sup>
        On September 27, 1983, Stallman announced his resolution:
        To produce a "complete UNIX-compatible software system," and to
        "give it away free."<a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.en.html#f1"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
        He called the project <a href="https://gnu.org">GNU</a>, a recursive
        acronym for
        <em>GNU's Not UNIX.</em><sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html">[11]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
        These ideas are expressed formally and generally through <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">copyleft</a></em>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        At the time of announcement, Stallman had not yet quantified his
        own intentions behind the word <em>free.</em>
        Certainly, "a free copy" did not embody the
        culture of code-sharing MIT was once home to.
        More, he did not wsih to put the code in the public domain because
        modified versions of it it could become proprietary.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft#History">[12]</a></sup>
        By 1985, Stallman had sorted these issues out:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
            GNU is not in the public domain. Everyone will be permitted to
            modify and redistribute GNU, but no distributor will be allowed to
            restrict its further redistribution. That is to say, proprietary
            modifications will not be allowed. I want to make sure that all
            versions of GNU remain free.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">[13]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Thus, software freedom became quantified:
        Users can run, study, modify, copy and distribute the software;
        but, if they distribute, then those freedoms must be preserved.
        These freedoms were implemented in the various
        licenses of early GNU products, and their parts were taken
        together to form the GNU
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#History">General Public License</a>,
        version 1.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#History">[14]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        About it, Linus Torvalds writes:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "Under the terms of the GPL, money is not the issue.
        You can charge a million bucks if someone is willing to pay
        for it, but you have to make sources available.
        And the person you give or sell the source to has to have
        all the rights you have.
        It's a brilliant device."<sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>

        To create an entire operating system is an enormous task, but

    <h2>The Linux Kernel </h2>

    <p>
        On August 25, 1991, a Finnish graduate student by the name of Linus Torvalds
        announced his own free operating system project.
        Again following the architecture of the UNIX operating system,
        his project was intended to be "...just a hobby, won't be big and
        professional like GNU."<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[16]</a></sup>

            Properly speaking, the name <em>Linux</em> refers only to the Linux kernel.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Whereas the GNU Project sought to
        produce an entire operating system, Linus restricted his
        attention to creating a kernel.
        By October of 1991, GNU's Bash, GCC, Make and other
        programs were running on his creation.<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[16]</a></sup>
        He soon released it under the GNU General Public License, Version 2.
        Later, he would write:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "The fact is, to make Linux usable, I had relied on a lot of tools that had
        been distributed freely over the Internet&mdash;I had hoisted myself up
        on the shoulders of giants.  The most important of these free software
        programs was the GCC compiler."<sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Linus Torvalds became interested in operating systems after
            finding an error in the source code of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL">Sinclair QL's</a> QDOS.
            <sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
            In college, Andrew Tanenbaum's
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_Systems:_Design_and_Implementation"><em>Operating Systems: Design and Implementation</em></a>
            took this interest to new heights.<sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Interest in the kernel flourished, in large part because
        of the informality of the project:
        <a href="pre/free-minix-like-kernel-sources-for-386-at.html">Everybody was invited,</a> if only
        to tinker.
        This development model&mdash; "release early and often, delegate everything you can,
        be open to the point of promiscuity"<sup><a href="#references">[17]</a></sup>&mdash; <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html#catbmain">raised eyebrows</a> at the time,
        but has proven sound in virtue of its overwhelming success:
        The Linux kernel has become the most-used UNIX-like kernel of all time.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/2.Process.html">kernel development process</a>
        has become more structured since 1991, and today uses a
        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/programming-in-nix.html#train-schedules">train-schedule</a> approach.
        Linus Torvalds remains the maintainer of the Development branch,
        and often remarks upon the kernel's latest releases.

        A major figure of today's Linux development effort is Greg Kroah-Hartman
        (pronounced "<em>Crow</em>-Hartman"), who maintains the Stable branch,
        in addition to various subsystems.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kroah-Hartman">[18]</a></sup>
        According to Kroah-Hartman, interest in the kernel continues to
        grow, with 1200 new developers contributing each
        year.<sup><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/26/linux_kernel_intel/">[19]</a></sup>
        Their main development bottlenecks are code review and
        maintainership.<sup><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/26/linux_kernel_intel/">[19]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Although the Linux kernel began as a hobby, it is an occupation
        for some, and serious affair for many.
        In particular, the kernel development team
        takes great care not to break
        user-space,<sup><a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75">[20]</a></sup>
        meaning that programs that <em>did</em> work will continue to
        work.
        In this way, they ensure the long-term stability of Linux-based
        systems.<sup><a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/235335/why-is-there-a-linux-kernel-policy-to-never-break-user-space">[21]</a></sup>

    <h2> Linux Distributions: A Brief History </h2>

    <p>
        The first versions of the Linux kernel were available
        only in source-code form, and required compilation on a
        host machine.<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[16]</a></sup>
        More, no other software was included, so that the
        creation of a functional Linux-based machine required
        the user to obtain, configure, compile and
        assemble a number of disparate software components.

        <center style="font-size: 12pt;">HJ Lu's Boot/Root Floppies</center>
    </div>

    <p>
        In 1992, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HJ_Lu">HJ Lu</a>
        began packaging utilities alongside the kernel and distributing the
        collection together on a pair of 5.25" disks.<sup><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/history-of-early-linux-distros/">[22]</a><a href="https://itsfoss.com/earliest-linux-distros/">[23]</a></sup>
        Known as <em>boot/root</em> floppies, they are
        the first known Linux distribution,<sup><a href="https://itsfoss.com/earliest-linux-distros/">[23]</a></sup>
        and worked similarly to a live CD:
        You booted from one disk, then replaced it when prompted.
        "After a while," says Joe Klemmer, "you got a command prompt."<sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/">[24]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Linux's first widely recognized and used distribution was, ironically,
        a commercial venture: Soft Landing System.<sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/">[24]</a></sup>
        Released in late 1992, SLS was sold under the slogan "Gentle Touchdowns for DOS Bailouts",<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System">[25]</a></sup>
        but users complained that the software was buggy,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System">[25]</a><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[26]</a></sup> and when its developers
        decided to change the executable file format, began to leave.<sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/">[14]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h3> Two Approaches </h3>

    <p>
        In late 1992, Patrick Volkerding needed a LISP interpreter for a project
        at school, and, having heard that <code>clisp</code> ran on SLS Linux,
        downloaded them both.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[26]</a></sup>
        His professor got wind, and asked Patrick to help him install the software
        on school computers.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[26]</a></sup>

        Volkerding walked him through installing, fixing and patching SLS, and
        afterward, his professor asked, "Is there some way we can fix the install disks so
        that the new machines will have these fixes right away?"<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[26]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        So Volkerding began improving SLS, and internally named his project
        <em>Slackware;</em> he didn't want the project taken too seriously.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[26]</a></sup>
        By May, though, the improvements were becoming substantial, and when
        first released on the internet in June, proved so popular that the
        number of download requests crashed the system hosting it.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[26]</a></sup>
        Volkerding hadn't intended to produce a distribution,<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[26]</a></sup> but still
        maintains <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> today.<sup><a href="http://www.slackware.com/about">[27]</a></sup>
        The Slackware Linux Project is aimed at producing, "the most UNIX-like
        Linux distribution out there."<sup><a href="http://www.slackware.com/info/">[28]</a></sup>

            Debian is one of the most respected distributions of our time,
            and is oft-used as an upstream source for other distributions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        In 1993, Ian Murdock also grew frustrated with SLS Linux,<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
        and, more, sought a better solution to distribution creation than
        single-person or closed-room schemes.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
        Ian wanted an operating system that lived up to the Linux name,
        was carefully and conscientiously assembled, and which was maintained
        with equal diligence.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
        In particular, he wanted a free operating system that could
        compete with commercial distributions.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Murdock decided to make the process open, in the spirit of GNU and Linux,
        thereby ensuring satisfaction of user's requirements.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[29]</a></sup>
        He named it <a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a>,
        a portmanteau of <em>Debra,</em> his wife, and <em>Ian,</em> himself.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/intro.en.html">[30]</a></sup>
        The project attracted developers, and today around
        a thousand people volunteer their spare time.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/intro/philosophy">[31]</a></sup>

        With the internet came many
        Linux distributions.
        I think of them as flavors of the same thing, rather than
        necessarily different.
        Since they are each based around the Linux kernel, and the kernel
        has the property that it does not change behavior across versions,
        they are fundamentally similar operating systems.

        but then, I'm a simple guy.
        Mint is a characteristically professional operating system,
        <!--and <strike>I used to wear polos to school</strike>-->
        and focuses on productivity&mdash; that means you'll be up and
        running before you know it.
        It is extremely new-user friendly, yet maintains the performance
        of any other UNIX-like operating system.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, Mint 19 introduced <em><a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift">Timeshift:</a></em>
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "Timeshift protects your system by taking incremental

        Mint offers the Cinnamon desktop environment;
        Windows users will feel right at home.
        I find it to be an attractive desktop, but it's only moderately
        customizable.
        Like many users, I want a desktop environment that stays out of my way,
        and Cinnamon does exactly that.

        <h4>Open Source</h4>
    <p>
        In the forty years since Richard Stallman began GNU
        (pronounced <em>guh-nu</em>), the free software landscape has seen a
        great deal of growth.
        In 1998, the term <em>open source</em> was invented as
        <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html">a less abrasive synonym</a>
        for <em>free software:</em>
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        We realized it was time to dump the confrontational attitude that has been
        associated with 'free software' in the past and sell the idea strictly on
        the same pragmatic, business-case grounds that motivated
        Netscape.<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981206185148/http://www.opensource.org/history.html">[32]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The result was a wealth of media attention, the
        <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/history/">Mozilla</a>.
        Both GNU and the OSI agree that their respective terms are
        nearly synonymous.<sup><a href="https://opensource.org/faq#free-software">[33]</a><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-open-overlap.html">[34]</a></sup>
        In this work, and in life, we will use "open-source"
        interchangeably with "free software".
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Today, the most popular open-source license is MIT's, by far.<sup><a href="https://github.blog/2015-03-09-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com/">[35]</a></sup>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        In addition, more developers have taken part, and introduced a number of
        licenses to suit their needs.
        These licenses can be divided into two classes:
        Permissive licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache, BSD) do not perpetuate
        themselves, and so indirectly allow derivate works to become proprietary;
        nonpermissive/copyleft licenses (e.g., GPL, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Public_License">MPL</a>), on the other hand, <em>do</em>
        perpetuate themselves.<sup><a href="https://opensource.org/faq#permissive">[36]</a><a href="https://opensource.org/faq#copyleft">[37]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        To be honest, a lot of developers have said, <em>To hell with this,</em>
        and introduced such novelties as the
        <a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~phk/">Beerware License</a>,
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL">Do What The Fuck You Want License</a>,
        and the <a href="https://unlicense.org/">Unlicense</a> (quite popular).
        These each, with varying degrees of professionalism, place code in the
        public domain;
        from there, anyone can claim it as their own, and can put it in any other work,
        under any other license.
