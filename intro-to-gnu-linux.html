      An operating system is a collection of software designed to facilitate
      the use of a computer.
      To this end, its two main responsibilities are to support running
      programs, known as processes, and to maintain persistent data, usually in the form of files.
      In addition, operating systems ease the task of creating
      useful programs (i.e., computer programming).
      Modern GNU/Linux offers the single best programming environment
      available today.

    <h2>GNU/Linux Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The GNU/Linux operating system has a clear and well-documented architecture,
      composed of several distinct layers:
    </p>

    <img src="assets/img/linux-architecture.png" style="height: 400px;">

    <p>
      At the heart of any machine is its hardware.
      Each piece of hardware
      has a software interface defined by the engineers that
      created it.
      These interfaces are varied at best.
    </p>

    <p>
      Directly interacting with hardware and providing a more-uniform interface to
      each piece is the task of the system's <em>drivers</em>. This software layer
      represents the deepest and most remote element of any operating system.
      While drivers can be installed on an as-needed basis, in Linux
      the tendency is to include many drivers, and use only those that are required.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the heart of any machine is its hardware, the heart of any GNU/Linux
      operating system is its kernel.
      The kernel uses drivers to direct the actions of the machine, at the
      behest of user-space programs.
      Because the expectations that we have for the system are great
      (running multiple programs concurrently, never losing files nor parts of
      files, weeks-long stability),
      this is a <em>large</em> and <em>involved</em> piece of software.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Linux kernel was began by Linus Torvalds, then a graduate student
      of the University of Helsinki.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">[1]</a></sup>
      Following the architecture of the Unix operating system,
      he wrote an open-source kernel as "...a hobby, won't be big and professional like [the GNU kernel]."
      He soon released it publicly under the free-and-open-source <em>GNU General Public License</em>, version 2.

        - Kernel
        - System Call API
        - Standard "Core" utilities


      System Call API:
      The operating system exposes a system call interface to each
      user-space process, allowing a process to instruct the kernel to carry out
      actions on its behalf.
        - POSIX / SUSv4
        - #?

      "Because programs are independent of the underlying hardware, it is easy
      to move them between UNIX systems running on different hardware if the programs
      do not make assumptions about the underlying hardware." (Bach, 5) [The Design of the Unix Operating System]

      Kernel:
      Between these two elements is the kernel.

      What is a kernel?
          - Began by Linus Torvals, the Linux Kernel

      The kernel is the software layer between user-space programs and hardware drivers.
      This is the largest software layer in the operating system construct; it is
      tasked with maintaining the filesystem, ensuring user-space processes do not
      interfere with each other, and scheduling processes in a fair and reasonable manner.

      A great number of kernels implement the Unix system-call API,

      "Core" Utilites:
      The standard collection of programs that help define the working "Linux" OS;
      Some of these are critical to operating system functionality (?? Examples ??)
        - GNU


      Bundling It All Up: The Distribution
        An operating system, precompiled for use.
        It includes a kernel, selected drivers, and selected utilities.

        Because Linux is open-source, it's relatively easy to produce your own distribution,
        and because it's free, anyone can do it.


      What will run Linux?
        - Just about anything!
        Pinebook Pro:
         a compelling alternative to mid-ranged Chromebooks that people convert into Linux laptops.
