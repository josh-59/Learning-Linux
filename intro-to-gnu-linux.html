    <h1>Introduction to GNU/Linux</h1>
    <h4> Cooler heads prevail </h4>

    <p>
      An operating system is a collection of software designed to facilitate
      the use of a computer.
      To this end, its two main responsibilities are to support running
      programs&mdash; known as processes&mdash; and to maintain persistent data, known as files.
      In addition, operating systems ease the task of creating
      useful programs by giving processes a predictable environment.
      Modern, open-source GNU/Linux offers the single best programming environment
      available today.

    <h2>Unix Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      GNU/Linux belongs to a large class of operating systems called
      <em>Unix-like,</em> sometimes referred to as <em>*nix.</em>
      The Unix operating system had a clear and well-documented architecture,
      which has been replicated many times in both open-source and proprietary contexts.
      An overview of its architecture is as follows:
    </p>

    <img src="assets/img/linux-architecture.png" style="height: 400px;">

    <p>
      <strong>Hardware:</strong>
      At the heart of any machine is its hardware.
      Each piece of hardware
      has a software interface defined by the engineers that
      created it.
      These interfaces are varied at best.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Drivers:</strong>
      Directly interacting with hardware and providing a more-uniform interface to
      each piece is the task of the system's <em>drivers</em>. This software layer
      represents the deepest and most remote element of any operating system.
      While drivers can be installed on an as-needed basis, in GNU/Linux
      the tendency is to include many drivers, and use only those that are required.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Kernel:</strong>
      While the heart of any machine is its hardware, the heart of any
      Unix-like operating system is its kernel.
      The kernel uses drivers to direct the actions of the machine, at the
      behest of processes.
      Because the expectations that we have for the system are great
      (running multiple programs concurrently, never losing files nor parts of
      files, weeks-long stability),
      this is a <em>large</em> and <em>involved</em> piece of software.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>System Calls:</strong>
      In order to permit interaction with the kernel, each
      Unix-like operating system employs a set of system calls.
      From a source-code point of view, system calls "look" and "act" like ordinary function
      calls, but their actions are not restricted to user-space; rather, they
      transcend the software hierarchy, often making changes at the hardware level.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Processes:</strong>
      Sometimes called a "user-space process," a process is an executing program.
      On Unix-like systems, processes run the entire show, and
      are the only means that a user has to interact with the system.
      That is, processes are a critical component of a functioning Unix-like operating system.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content" id="linux-kernel">
      <h2>The Linux Kernel</h2>
      <p>
        Properly speaking, the name <em>Linux</em> refers only to the Linux Kernel.
        The Linux Kernel was started by Linus Torvalds in 1991, then a graduate student
        of the University of Helsinki.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">[1]</a></sup>
        Following the architecture of the Unix operating system,
        he wrote an open-source operating system as "...a hobby, won't be big and professional like
        [the GNU Project]."<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#History">[2]</a></sup>
        He soon released it publicly under the free-and-open-source <em>GNU General Public License, version 2.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Since then, the Linux kernel has become very successful, becoming
        the most-used Unix-like kernel in existence.
        Demands on the kernel development process are great:
        It must facilitate change, so that new features may be incorporated;
        it must yield stable kernels, for private and commercial use; most
        importantly, it must accept patches from thousands of unknown and volunteer developers each month.
        As such, the development process is somewhat involved.
        Documentation about it is maintained
        <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process?h=v5.8-rc1">within the source code.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Linus Torvalds remains the maintainer of the Development branch today.
        (One does not contact Linus Torvalds; this is here only because it is interesting.)
        Another major figure in Linux development is Greg Kroah-Hartman (pronounced "<em>Crow</em>-Hartman").
        He is currently the maintainer of the Stable branch.

      <h2>GNU</h2>
      <p>
        Development and deployment of Unix-like operating systems is
        contingent upon some user-space programs, such as a C compiler and
        an <em>sh</em>-compatible shell.
        GNU (pronounced <em>gah-new</em>) is well-known for producing high-quality, well-documented
        free software; they are as "official" as the open-source community gets.
      </p>

      <div class="aside-right">
        <h4> From <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">gnu.org:</a> </h4>
        <p>
          “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community.
          Roughly, it means that <strong>the users have the freedom to run, copy,
          distribute, study, change and improve the software.</strong>[sic]
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The GNU Project was started by Richard Stallman in September 1983,<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html">[3]</a></sup>
        and takes freedom very seriously.
        In GNU language, <em>free</em> software does not mean merely, "costs nothing."
        Rather, it is intended to mean <em>free as in
        freedom.</em><sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">[4]</a></sup>
        GNU and the open-source community often use
        the term <em>libre</em> to connote this kind of freedom.
        It should speak volumes that Linus Torvalds chose to release his budding
        kernel under a GNU license.
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>gcc</code> is the de-facto compiler on GNU/Linux operating
        systems.  It stands for <em>GNU Compiler Collection,</em> and is
        exclusively used to build Linux kernels.
        <code>bash</code> is the default shell on these systems; it also is maintained
        by the GNU project.
        Each tool offered by GNU is well-documented, so look to them for
        official documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        A point of note:
        The GNU maintains a list of "free" operating systems on their website.
        Their criteria is extremely restrictive, disallowing non-free software to
        exist even in downloadable form on the distributions' package-management repositories.
        Most Linux distributions are not listed; this is permissiveness on the part
        of the distribution's maintainer, allowing non-free software to be
        officially supported, and does not mean that you can't use it.

    <div class="content" id="posix">
      <h2> POSIX </h2>
      <p>
        The set of system calls that an operating system provides
        determines the interface that any user-space process has
        to the operating system, and thus to the machine.
        In order to assure software portability across operating systems, it is
        essential that this interface be (mostly) uniform.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first <em>Portable Operating System Interface</em> specification
        was released as an IEEE standard in 1988,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#Name">[5]</a></sup>
        and specified the system-call interface available to user-space programs.
        This standard has been refined since then.
        Operating systems that abide by this standard are called <em>POSIX Compliant;</em>
        systems developers general aim for POSIX compliance.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">[6]</a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        A stronger specification is the <em>Single Unix Specification,</em>
        which is a superset of POSIX.<sup><a href="#references">[7]</a></sup>
        Certification to this standard is costly, and is generally reserved for proprietary operating systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the system-call interface is not the only means of interacting with
        the kernel, and properly speaking belongs to the kernel,
        I feel it sufficiently important to be depicted above as an additional layer;
        most interactions between processes and the operating system occur
        through the system-call interface.
      </p>

</div>

<div id="distributions" class="content">
    <h2> Linux Distributions </h2>
    <p>
      A distribution is a collection of software that, when installed, yields
      a functioning operating system.
      Each will include a kernel, compiled with some drivers, core utilities,
      and, usually, some other user-space applications (e.g., Firefox).
      All of this is tested to work and will be packaged in a fashion that facilitates installation
      (usually, an ISO).
    </p>

    <p>
      In my opinion, distributions are more similar than dissimilar.
      Think of them as flavors of the Unix architecture, rather than distinct operating systems.
      The oldest distribution that's still maintained is
      <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware">[8]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the key distinctions between distributions is the package management
      system that is provided.
      The package-management system is intended to be the user's interface
      to obtaining, installing and upgrading software; it's similar
      to a <em>Store</em> on closed-source OS's.
      While the user is free to install software "by hand," this is generally
      discouraged because the package-management system allows the centralized
      and automated maintenance of software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Distributions differ in philosophy towards software that's appropriate to their
      operating system.
      Loosely, newer software has newer features, but
      is less stable than older software.
      For an operating system intended to be used on a server (e.g., <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>),
      the maintainers would tend towards reliable, stable,
      well-tested and mature user-space software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some distributions follow a "rolling release" development cycle&mdash; notably,
      <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux">Arch.</a>
      This method of delivering software focuses on obtaining and using the
      latest version of each.
      Under the rolling release paradigm, new software releases are expected to
      work correctly only with the latest software releases.
      The user is expected to update/upgrade frequently, but is guaranteed that
      each system-wide update will yield a coherent collection of software.

<div id="mint" class="content">
    <h2> Linux Mint </h2>
    <p>
      I like <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint,</a> but then, I'm a simple guy.
      This distribution is <em>downstream</em> of Debian, which means that
      it's a derivative of Debian.
      It inherits their package-management tool, <code>apt</code>,
      and the philosophy towards software that this implies.
      Linux Mint is a characteristically professional operating system, and focuses on
      productivity.  It is extremely new-user friendly, but retains the power
      of any other Unix-like operating system.

    <p>
      Mint offers the Cinnamon desktop environment;
      Windows users will feel right at home.
      It's a decently attractive desktop, but only moderately customizable.
      Like many users, I just want to get to work, so a
      desktop environment that stays out of my way helps me do exactly that.
    </p>

    <p>
      New for Linux Mint 19 is <em>Timeshift.</em> From <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift">their github:</a>
      "Timeshift for Linux is an application that provides functionality
      similar to the <em>System Restore</em> feature in Windows and the <em>Time Machine</em>
      tool in Mac OS. Timeshift protects your system by taking incremental
      snapshots of the file system at regular intervals. These snapshots
      can be restored at a later date to undo all changes to the system."
    </p>

    <p>
      I recommend using Timeshift&mdash;  It's saved my butt a few times.
      You will be queried about it (and other optional things)
      at the end of installation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mint isn't perfect: Being founded upon a server distribution,
      it is not well-suited to kernel development.
      A more appropriate distribution for that task would be
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)">Fedora</a>.
