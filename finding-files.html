    <h1>Finding Files with <code>fd</code></h1>

    <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">fd</a> 
        utility is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to 
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/">find</a>.
        Usage:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ fd [PATTERN] [PATH]
    </div>

    <p>
        Where <em>pattern</em> is a regular expression, and
        <em>path</em> is the directory you'd like to start looking in.
        It searches there, and then it searches recursively downward through 
        the directory tree which started there.
        For each file, it attempts to match its basename against <em>pattern.</em>
        If it matches, it then prints the name of the file.
    </p>

    <p>
        By default, <code>fd</code> checks filenames, but it can check any other 
        file characteristic, as well.
        For instance, to restrict results to directories, we could use
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ fd --type d [PATTERN] [PATH]
    </div>

    <p>
        For a few reasons, I recommend <code>fd</code> over the classic 
        GNU Findutils:
    </p>

    <ol style="margin-left: 5%; padding-right: 10%;">
        <li>
            <p>
                Only one utility to learn.
                In practice, <code>fd</code> replaces both <code>find</code> 
                and <code>locate</code>.
                Specifically, it's fast and friendly enough that there's no longer
                a need for <em>locate</em>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Ameniable defaults.
                <code>fd</code> matches only basenames, and thereby avoids printing
                pages of results.
                More, it does not require a flag to search for filenames.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Regex by default.
                Regex is a more powerful and expressive string-matching language
                than shell globbing.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Simpler in Construction.
                No database to worry about.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Searching Files with <code>rg</code></h3>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>rg</code></a> 
        utility recursively descends through a directory tree, 
        opens each file, reads its contents and attempts to
        match each line against a given regex pattern.
        If a line matches, it then prints the filename and those lines;
        effectively, it searches files for a particular pattern.
        Its simplest usage is:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ rg PATTERN [PATH...]
    </div>

    <p>
        This, again, is a reimagining of a classic UNIX utility&mdash; 
        in this case, the venerable 
        <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a></em>.
        It's mostly just easier to use.
    </p>

        Your primary documentation for regex is <a href="https://docs.rs/regex/1.4.3/regex/#syntax">here</a>. Trust me on this.
