  <h2> Programs </h2>

  <p>
    As stated above, a program is a file containing instructions on how to create
    a process.
    Most programs are in binary format, which means that they
    have been compiled for native use by the computer.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first Unix binary executable file format was called <em>a.out,</em>
        which stood for <em>assembler output.</em><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.out">[5]</a></sup>
        This was a very simple format, with three distinct data segments that
        coincided with the layout of the resulting process's memory:
    </p>

  <ol>
    <li> Text &mdash; Machine instructions </li>
    <li> Data &mdash; Initial values for global and static variables</li>
    <li> BSS &mdash; Uninitialized global and static variable values; assigned arithmetic zero by the kernel upon loading</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The binary format currently in use is
    <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/ELF">ELF</a>.
    Command-line tools for peeking into such a file
    include:<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#Tools">[21]</a></sup>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> <code>file</code> &mdash; Provide a brief description of any filetype</li>
    <li> <code>size</code> &mdash; List section sizes above<li>
    <li> <code>readelf</code> &mdash; Display detailed information about ELF files</li>
    <li> <code>objdump</code> &mdash; "... mostly useful to programmers who are working on compilation tools,
      as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and
      work."<sup><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/objdump.1.html">[19]</a></sup></li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Script </h3>
  <p>
    A script is a text file that is executable.
    Scripts must begin with the magic characters <em>#!</em> , then the
    complete pathname of the desired interpreter, as in
  </p>

  <div class="aside-right">
    <h4>Aside:</h4>
    <p>
      To execute a file in the current working directory, use
      <br><center><code>./file</code></center><br>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="code">
    #! /bin/bash
  </div>

  <p>
    or
  </p>

  <div class="code">
    #! /usr/bin/python.
  </div>

  <p>
    This line is often called <em>shebang</em> or <em>hashbang</em>.
    Note that this feature is implemented by the kernel:  The kernel
    itself is passed the script via <em>exec</em>, and
    goes about executing the interpreter given, with the file as an
    argument to it.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)#History">[5]</a></sup>
    Also, Bash will attempt to execute the file within a subshell,
    if no hashbang line exists.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Scripts.html#Shell-Scripts">[22]</a></sup>
