Configuration files

  Used to store text-based configuration files; there are many in
  the home directory and many in the ~/.config folder

Directories
    *Using the filesystem to implement the directory tree*
  Are called "directories" rather than "folders" because they are files&mdash;
  think of a Unix <i>directory</i> as a page in a telephone book.

  Process Working Directory
    The kernel itself supports the notion of a process having a <i>current</i>
    directory(APUE p135

    is set at login to the home directory specified in /etc/passwd

    /proc/self/cwd
    char *getcwd(char *buf, size_t size);
      // Starts at current directory, gets name via '.', then travels up (via '..'),
      and repeats.
    +x "search" permission

inode:
    man inode

  For each file these exists a unique inode containing metadata about the file:
    owner
    group
    type
    permissions
    last-accessed time and date
    last-modified time and date
    inode-modified time and date
    size
    number of links to the file
    disk addresses
