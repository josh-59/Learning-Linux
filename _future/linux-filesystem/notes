"dotfiles"
Configuration files
https://fedoramagazine.org/take-back-your-dotfiles-with-chezmoi/
  Used to store text-based configuration files; there are many in
  the home directory and many in the ~/.config folder

Directories
    *Using the filesystem to implement the directory tree*
  Are called "directories" rather than "folders" because they are files&mdash;
  think of a Unix <i>directory</i> as a page in a telephone book.

  Process Working Directory
    The kernel itself supports the notion of a process having a <i>current</i>
    directory(APUE p135

    is set at login to the home directory specified in /etc/passwd

    /proc/self/cwd
    char *getcwd(char *buf, size_t size);
      // Starts at current directory, gets name via '.', then travels up (via '..'),
      and repeats.

    +x "search" permission

    The Design of the Unix Operating System


  File "handle"
  Placed at the beginning of the logical partition

  For each file these exists a unique inode containing metadata about the file:
    owner
    group
    type
    permissions
    last-accessed time and date
    last-modified time and date
    inode-modified time and date
    size
    number of links to the file
    disk addresses
      (The design of the unix operating system)

  inode number -> index into array
  Since neither links nor data addresses can cross disk partition
  boundaries, the inode number is sufficient to uniquely identify an inode.

    Kernighan page 132:
        Invented by John Mashey and introduced in the 6th edition shell,
        it was a workaround so that non-expert users could
        share their own sets of commands by lab, department and group.
