The GNU/Linux operating system ;

    The Linux kernel facilitates process creation, supports existing processes,
    and launches exactly one, but otherwise pays no attention to processes;
    there's a very clear division of responsibilities, here:
    The kernel will exist with zero processes.
    It would, however, be impossible to interact with, and hence, useless.

This is known as the <em>init</em> process. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init


                          Process Attributes:
    PID



Process Structure:
    Memory:

    Environment Variables:

    Current working directory:


        Command: Printenv: can be called by any process,
                            prints the environment inherited from that process
                            (which is given to printenv).

		    Current working directory:
				<p>
					Each process has a <em>current working directory</em>, a place in
          the directory tree.
          This value is maintained by the kernel; changing a process's
					current working directory requires the use of a system call.
				</p>



  Commands:
      ps - Who have I invited in
      ps -e - Who's here
      pstree- Who invited who
      vmstat- Who's using what

	Inter-process communication:
			- Since each process has its own memory, sending messages between
				processes is not as simple as "select the process and write to its memory";
				Channels of inter-process communication must be supported by operating system,
				and then used appropriately by processes.
			- Signals
