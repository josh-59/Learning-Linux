Overarching Goal:
	<em> Learning Linux </em>
	A book-like covering the persistent concepts of Linux, for the
	new user.


1)  Operating Systems
	a) What's an OS
	b) Why Linux
		<em>Superlative</em> programming environment:  Why this makes sense
	c) Distros
		Think of these as flavors of Linux; they mostly share the GNU/Linux
		kernel / coreutils fundamentals, the same ethos (make small tools and make them well),
		the same open-ness
2)  Package Managers -> Up-front and center!
3)  The Linux Directory Tree
4)  Processes
4)  Shells
6)	An Introduction to Vim
7)  Text Terminals-> Rewrite?
8)	Finding Files
9)  Learning Linux
11) Going Further: Programming in Linux
	a) The Importance of C
	b) Rust?
	c) Command-line tools vs. Scripting Language
		Set of wrenches vs ratchet set

13) About
	The Social Contract
		There is an implicit social contract between the writer of a given work
		and their reader(s).
		The deal is, I can't guarantee that what I write is what you want to hear.  What I
		can guarantee is that <em>if</em> you read this work,
		I will provide a precise rendition of valuable material.
