    Moreover, shells also allow their users to create their own functions.

    Shell functions can be quite elaborate, containing conditional statements and redirections
    (anything persmissible in ordinary usage).

    A <strong>builtin</code> is a command that is implemented in the shell.
    Builtins are commands that are so closely ties to the shell
    that it is impossible to implement them as external
    commands.<sup>FISH DOCUMENTATION</sup>.

    An example of a builtin in <code>fish</code> is <code>fish_prompt</code>,
    which is called before the shell queries the user for a new line.
    We can list these functions with the <code>functions</code> builtin:
</p>

<div class="code">
    $ functions
</div>

    The problem with this is that the shell searches its own set of functions
    before searching <code>PATH</code>, consequently, a locally-defined function
    will "override" any executable located in <code>PATH</code>.

<div class="aside-right">
  <h4>Aside:</h4>
  <p>
    To assert the existence of a command, query its version with <code>-v</code>
  </p>
</div>

PATH environment variable:
Kernighan page 132:
    Invented by John Mashey and introduced in the 6th edition shell,
    it was a workaround so that non-expert users could
    share their own sets of commands by lab, department and group.

    It's a classic project for computer science students to
    write their own shells.
    The fun is to be had, primarily, in parsing the line :).
