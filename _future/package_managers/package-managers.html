    <h1>Package Managers </h1>
    <h4>Under Construction!</h4>

	<p>
		Package managers facilitate the installation, patching and removal
		of software; their importance is difficult to overstate.
		Modern package managers exist for every major open-source project, such as
		Debian, Python, Ruby, Rust or Arch, to name a few.
		Packages deal in compiled programs, rather than source code.
	</p>

	<h2> Life Without Package Managers </h2>

	<p>
		To motivate this discussion, let us consider life without package managers.
		

	<h2> What is a Package? </h2>
	<p>
		From the ArchWiki Pacman page:
		A package is an archive containing:

		<ul>
			<li> The compiled files of an application </li>
	    	<li> Metadata about the application (application name, version, dependencies, etc.) </li>
			<li> Installation directives for <code>pacman</code> </li>
			<li> Extra, optional files, such as scripts </li>
		</ul>

		</p>

		<p>
			The compiled files that form the core of an application are an obvious
			component of each package; however, in order to manage packages in
			an efficient manner, each package must contain metadata describing itself.
			One method to store this information might be to keep it in the executables themselves&mdash;
			version numbers appended to the executable filename, say.
			This would not be extensible, nor pleasant to use.

		</p>

		<p>
			All modern package
			A package does not contain copies of common libraries and executables.
