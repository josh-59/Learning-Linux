In the beginning, there was a filesystem.

A Heirarchical structure, with some files holding listings of other files.


Regular Files
  Data contents are not, in the general case, the business of the operating system;
  operating system is only tasked with preserving the data in a bit-perfect
  manner.
  That means that the Linux kernel treats text files, binaries, movies,
  source code, pdf's, etc., identically, (a concept new for its time),
  and, that any "special treatment," is implemented by user-space processes.
  As Brian Kerninghan puts it, "If applying a program to a file doesn't make sense&mdash; for
  example, trying to compile a Fortran source file as if it were C&mdash; that doesn't have anything
  to do with the operating system."  (Kernigham, p 63)

   (for instance, the desktop environment).

   chmod +x:
     Change the way the operating system handles a file;
     <i>in addition</i> to the above, the operating system can now
     "execute" the file:
     Binary
     #! /usr/bin/XXXXXXX
     Bash's behavior by default

     For instance, the ruby interpreter is a program, existant in my filesystem
     as a binary file compiled from C source code; to execute a ruby program,
     I pass the argument <tt>ruby my_example_program.rb </tt> to bash,
     causing the kernel to launch ruby with the argument file <tt>my_example_program.rb</tt>.

"dotfiles"
Configuration files
https://fedoramagazine.org/take-back-your-dotfiles-with-chezmoi/
  Used to store text-based configuration files; there are many in
  the home directory and many in the ~/.config folder

Directories
  Are called "directories" rather than "folders" because they are files&mdash;
  think of a Unix <i>directory</i> as a page in a telephone book.

  Process Working Directory
    The kernel itself supports the notion of a process having a <i>current</i>
    directory(APUE p135

    is set at login to the home directory specified in /etc/passwd

    /proc/self/cwd
    char *getcwd(char *buf, size_t size);
      // Starts at current directory, gets name via '.', then travels up (via '..'),
      and repeats.

    +x "search" permission

Device Files

Pseudo Filesystems
Meta-Persistent Filesystems

virtual filesystem,

Abstracting away from machine state;
  in particular we are IGNORING running programs.
This amounts to ignoring half of the operating system,
but it is appropriate because files are static with
respect to processes.


stdin / stdout
  lsof - list open files

pipes:
  A Beautiful Abstraction

  The file-first mentality projected by Unix lets you work with the output of
  programs as though they were files.
  For instance,
    ls /dev > dev_listing
  doesn't make any sense because the output of "ls /dev" is conceptually identical to
  a file anyways.

Kernighan: Commands are verbs, and files
are nouns, p 71

Linux files as variables:
  "A file has an owner, a modification time, a size, a type, and other attributes." --Understanding Unix/Linux Programming:  A Guide to Theory and Practice
  Names
    Found in directories
    Can have aliases
  Addresses
    Disk block locations
  Value
    Data
  Type
    Ordinary file
    Directory
    Special device file
    etc
  Lifetime
    Static wrt system:
      /etc/passwd
      /home
    Static wrt programs:
      program-specific binaries
    User-defined:
      User-owned files
    Runtime-only
  Scope

locate:
  Considers files by name

GNU Find:
  Considers files as such
  A much deeper search

grep:

STDIN / STDOUT
vis:
  use argument '-' to create an interactive filter

inode:

    The Design of the Unix Operating System


  File "handle"
  Placed at the beginning of the logical partition

  For each file these exists a unique inode containing metadata about the file:
    owner
    group
    type
    permissions
    last-accessed time and date
    last-modified time and date
    inode-modified time and date
    size
    number of links to the file
    disk addresses
      (The design of the unix operating system)

  inode number -> index into array
  Since neither links nor data addresses can cross disk partition
  boundaries, the inode number is sufficient to uniquely identify an inode.




Shell:
    A text terminal is a device that lets a user "peer into" the computer
    by reading on a monitor the data written to a special file.
    In days' past, the text terminal was physical; these days, the
    device has been replaced by emulation.
    The most novel thing to recognize about terminals is that they exist, from the operating system's
    perspective, as an ordinary file.
    That <i>you read</i> from it is merely coincidental to what that file is connected to&mdash; namely,
    a buffer within a monitor or emulator.
    Likewise, data sent from the keyboard appears, to a user-space process,
    as the contents of an ordinary file.

    PATH environment variable:
    Kernighan page 132:
        Invented by John Mashey and introduced in the 6th edition shell,
        it was a workaround so that non-expert users could
        share their own sets of commands by lab, department and group.
