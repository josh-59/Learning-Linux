    <h1>Text Terminals </h1>
    <h4>A Historical Perspective </h4>
    <p>
        A <i>text terminal</i> is a computer peripheral similar to a mouse and keyboard combination
        (<a href="https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-1.html#ss1.6">Lawyer, Section 1.6</a>).
        However, whereas a modern monitor receives a pixel-wise description of output to display
        from the computer several times a second, a text terminal receives a description of
        the characters to display only once, and uses an onboard buffer to store that information.
        Text terminals are an archaic and largely obsolete technology, but were instrumental to the
        development of modern GNU/Linux.
        This paper looks at the technology and its ramifications as seen in Linux today.

    <h2> History </h2>
    <p>
        The history of Unix is well outside the scope of this discussion.
        However, the text terminal is best understood from a historical
        perspective.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <i>Teletype</i> was a trade name of the Teletype Corporation, and was subsequently abbreviated to <i>tty</i>.
        <a href="http://www.pdp8.net/asr33/videos.shtml">The Model 33</a> was among the most popular hard-copy terminals,
        with around 600,000 units sold (<a href="#references">Libes 129</a>).
    </div>

    <p>
        The computers of the 1960's and 70's were prohibitively expensive.
        The "Programmed Data Processor-7," which the first inklings of Unix can be traced to,<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[1]</a></sup>
        would have cost the equivalent of about $600,000 in 2020, and shipped with 18 kilobytes of memory.
        These computers were bought and maintained by
        organizations, with the idea of developing timesharing (i.e., multiuser) operating systems.
        In fact, it was once envisioned that computing would be offered as a utility,
        piped into homes and businesses like telephone or electricity.
        This vision formed the impetus of Multics, the precursor to Unix.<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[1]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Second, the technological state of the 1960's included the <a href="https://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tel/teletype.htm"<i>teletypewriter</i></a>,
        a device for sending telegrams.
        These were, essentially, remote-controlled typewriters, and in the 1960's, they were repurposed to
        interface with computers.
        The resulting abstraction formed the basis of the input/output mechanism of early interactive computing.
        Paper-based terminals persisted well into the 1970's, and later electronic typewriters
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-u4kUeIqDI">sometimes support "terminal mode,"</a>
        allowing them to interface with computers via serial cable.

    <h2> Terminals </h2>

    <p>
        As interactive computing became more popular, hard-copy terminals were phased out in favor of
        screen-based entities.
        The resulting devices, referred to as <i>text terminals,</i> consisted of a monitor and a keyboard;
        the monitor was unlike a modern monitor in that it contained a buffer
        (on the order of a few kilobytes<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[3]</a></sup>)
        which maintained the text currently on screen, and in that it contained a character-to-bitmap font table to be referenced
        when drawing each character; that is, it included its own font.
    </p>
    <a class="img-left" title="The original uploader was Frotz at English Wikipedia. / CC BY-SA (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:VT78.jpg"><img width="300" alt="VT78" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/VT78.jpg/512px-VT78.jpg"></a>

    <p>
        The computer itself was not required to draw each character on-screen; that was the responsibility of
        the terminal.
        Rather, the mainframe was only expected to tell the terminal <i>which</i> characters to draw, once.
        Users would sit at a terminal, connected to a (possibly distant) machine, would type in
        programs, issue commands, enter data, etc.; a serial cable connected this I/O device to the computer,
        and it was termed a <i>terminal,</i> since it was located at the terminal end of this cable.
    </p>

    <p>
        The text terminal <a href="https://www.vt100.net/dec/vt_history">was used for decades</a> as the principle means of interactive computing.
        It's worth noting that each new model implemented a superset of a previous model's capabilities,
        so that, for instance, a VT200-series terminal can-do anything a VT100 could-do<sup><a href="#references">[4]</a></sup>
        Today, text terminals are obsolete, but the abstraction persists in both modern Linux and Unix,
        via emulated terminals, tty device files, virtual terminals, and the associated back-end software required to support them.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's worth noting that the idea of mainframe-driven utility computation suggests that the computer's organization
        follows the sctructure of a mathematical tree:
        The "root user" would sit at the root of this tree, exercising super-user priveledges over the machine,
        while end-users would be positioned at the leaves of the tree.

    <h3> Emulation </h3>
    <p>
        Primarily, terminals persist in modern Linux in the form of <i>terminal emulators</i>.
        These are user-space processes that, well, emulate an old terminal!
        Specifically, they provide a GUI-compatable front-end to an old-school interface.
        Terminal emulation is notoriously difficult,
        and is characterized by <i>which</i> terminal device you are emulating (Shuford).
    </p>

    <p>
        Information about the capabilities of supported terminals is stored locally in a database known as <code>terminfo</code><sup><a href="#references">[5]</a></sup>.
        Terminal emulators are typically backward-compatable with the VT100 (xterm, for instance, is backward compatable with the both the VT100 and VT220<sup><a href="#references">[6]</a></sup>),
        but often support additional capabilities, such as color, and so often have a distinct entry in the terminfo database.
    </p>

    <h2> Device Files </h2>

    <p>
        A terminal is connected to a computer by a full-duplex communication pipeline.
        In days' past, this was a serial port.
        The Unix environment presents an abstraction of the terminal as a special device file.
        Located in <code>/dev</code>, the <code>tty</code> files are available to each user-space process
        using a terminal for input or output.
        A program can open, read from and write to a tty file, with the operating system
        being responsible for the details.

    <p>
        By this method, user-space programs have access to nontrivial, if elementary, input and output,
        by the trivial method of file access.
        Moreover, for a Unix system accessed through a terminal, the flow of data
        through the tty files represents the entirety of input and output.
    </p>

    <p>
        Common to all tty devices is the application of a kernel module called
        the <i>terminal line discipline</i>, which serves to interpret
        input and produce a more human-amiable interface.
        For instance, input is line-buffered by default, so that the user can modify a line
        (e.g., backspace) before sending the input to their program.
    </p>

    <h3> Virtual Terminals: <br><code>/dev/tty1</code> thru <code>/dev/tty63</code> </h3>
    <p>
        Virtual terminals are the closest re-imaging of the classic terminal-bound
        interface to be found in modern operating systems.
        They are full-screen terminal displays on the system video monitor,
        and are accessible by pressing the key combination CTRL+ALT+F[1-9]
        (use CTRL-ALT+F7 to get back!).
        You may log in to different virtual terminals simultaneously,
        and thus have a few different sessions with the computer going on at the same time.
        In the example below, 'josh' (me) owns the second virtual terminal
        (in fact, it's because I'm signed in there!).
    </p>

        Virtual terminals are more than just a throwback to multiuser operating
        system days:  They allow access to the machine
        without a graphical user interface and, in particular, without the associated
        software (namely, without a window server, window manager, and desktop environment).
        In modern desktop GNU/Linux distributions, it is often the case that
        GUI-based systems software is merely an additional front-end layer to command-line tools
        (a common example is the
        <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/synaptic/"> Synaptic Package Manager</a>).
        That is, the command-line interface usually offers more and finer control over
        the machine, through less and more robust software.
        Virtual terminals are still highly relevant within the context of server applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        The user of a modern GNU/Linux distribution running a GUI is usually logged into the
        seventh virtual terminal, <code>/dev/tty7</code>.
        For completeness' sake, we will briefly explore how it is that the system arrives in this
        state.
        At the end of the kernel's boot sequence, the kernel launches a single
        user-space process with root permissions<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[7]</a></sup>
        <sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[8]</a></sup>
        (commonly, <i><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd">systemd</a></i>).
        This process then launches the local window system, which, in turn, logs in at
        an empty virtual terminal.
        This process is almost always X Window Server, and it logs in to <code>tty7</code>,
        and launches the graphical user interface<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[9]</a></sup>.
        One can emulate this sequence by logging into a virtual terminal and launching
        the system's window server by, for instance, <code>sudo startx</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>/dev/tty0</code> is a somewhat special virtual terminal device because it is
        a synonym for the current virtual terminal.
        That is, if you are currently looking at the seventh virtual terminal, <code>tty7</code>, then data sent to <code>tty0</code>
        is sent to <code>tty7</code> (and not any other terminal).
        <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/60641/linux-difference-between-dev-console-dev-tty-and-dev-tty0">
            This unix.stackexchange answer</a> provides a great explanation, and a demonstration.
        </p>

        <h3>The Controlling Terminal:<br> /dev/tty </h3>
        <p>
            <code>/dev/tty</code> is a handle to the process's current tty device, if it exists<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[10]</a></sup>.
            It is, effectively, a process-specific file: Any process that is connected to a terminal
            may access its terminal here
            <sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[11]</a></sup>.
        </p>

        <h4> Demonstration </h4>
        <ol>
            <li> Open up two terminal emulators</li>
            <li> Navigate each to <code>/dev</code></li>
            <li> In each, confirm that <code>tty</code> exists, is a character device, and has universal write permissions</li>
            <li> In each, confirm that writing to <code>tty</code> (e.g. <code>echo "stuff" > tty</code>) does not write to the other </li>
        </ol>

        <h3> Pseudoterminals: <br>pts/ </h3>
        <p>
            From
            <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.4/admin-guide/devices.html#terminal-devices"> Kernel.org Documentation</a>,
            "Pseudoterminals are used to create login sessions or provide other capabilities
            requiring a TTY line discipline to arbitrary data-generation processes."
            Pseudoterminals have no physical devices connected; rather, they are
            intended to pipe information through the kernel's terminal line discipline
            by connecting two distinct points in the file system,
            a <i>master</i>, <code>/dev/ptmx</code>, and a
            <i>slave</i>, a file with an integral filename, found in <code>/dev/pts</code>.
        </p>

        <div class="aside-right">
            <h4> Aside </h4>
            <p>
                Historically, there have been
                <a href="https://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-2.html">many names for terminal devices.</a>
                This essay develops <i>terminal</i> exclusively, for the sake of
                clarity and relevance in the modern domain.
                The only other synonym in common usage is "console," as in, "<i><code>/dev/tty1</code>
                    through <code>/dev/tty7</code> are virtual consoles</i>
                    <sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[12]</a></sup>."
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                A user-space process opens the "master" side, <code>/dev/ptmx</code>,
                as an ordinary file.
                The kernel responds by returning a new file descriptor,
                and also by creating a new <i>slave</i> device file in <code>/dev/pts</code>.
                The process can then call <code>ptsname(int fd)</code>, passing the file
                descriptor given by opening the master side, whereby the kernel will return
                the pathname to the corresponding slave (terminal) device file.
            </p>

            <p>
                At this point, the process can treat the slave side of the pipe
                as a tty device, and the kernel will modify the stream as
                appropriate.
                The most common use of pseudoterminals is by terminal emulator programs.
                See <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/4/ptmx"> man 4 ptmx </a> and
                <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/ptsname"> man 3 ptsname </a>
                for more information.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a lot of things you can do with pseudoterminals, and studying
                them goes a long way towards understanding the Unix filesystem concept.
                What you're doing is, you're piping a stream of characters through the kernel,
                and requesting that the kernel modify this stream in a way peculiar to
                a kernel module called the "terminal line discipline."
                We'll get into more detail about the terminal line discipline in the
                next section.
            </p>

            <h4> Demonstration </h4>
            <ol>
                <li> Open exactly two terminal emulators</li>
                <li> Navigate one to <code>/dev/pts</code></li>
                <li> List the directory contents and note its entries (should be nonempty)</li>
                <li> For each integral entry, write a string to the file, (e.g., <code>echo hello &gt; 2</code>) </li>
            </ol>

                This is the superuser's device.
                Kernel errors and other messages are sent here<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[12]</a></sup>, and the device
                is owned entirely by the root user:

            <h2> Escape Sequences </h2>
            <p>
                It's worth repeating at this point that the terminal <i>proper</i> only sends a stream of bytes, and
                merely receives a stream of bytes.
                That is, the only method of sending data to a terminal monitor is by the same channel as
                printable characters.
                As a consequence, it is necessary to establish some common standard for communicating to the terminal
                non-printable, or <i>control</i>, characters, such as "newline."
                In the US, printable characters were traditionally mapped via ASCII (with the exception of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC"> some early IBM mainframes</a>).
                The first 32 ASCII characters (decimal 0 through 31) are control characters, rather than printable.
                They include the famous bell character, and both tab and newline (aka, "linefeed");
                in order to delete previously written text, one can print the backspace
                character, decimal 8 (see <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ascii.7.html"> man ascii </a> for more information).
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of these control characters quickly became antiquated, so that the majority are not widely used.
                For instance, ASCII alone does not provide provisions for moving the cursor or scrolling.
                As a consequence, the more extensible mechanism of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequence">escape sequences</a> was developed.
                The sequences in use were soon standardized by ANSI, and their support became ubiquitous.
                Each of these sequences begins with the ASCII "escape" control character (decimal 27)
                and the left-bracket "<code>[</code>" printable<sup><a href="#references">[13]</a></sup>.
                They are sequences of entirely ASCII characters.
                Technically, the're terminal-specific, but are still viable today
                because modern emulators typically
                <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/43945/whats-the-difference-between-various-term-variables">implement a superset</a>
                of older terminals' escape sequences.
                Within C, to print <i>Hello World!</i> in reverse, we could do
            </p>

            <div class="code">
                #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>
                <br>
                int main() {<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;printf("\033[7m Hello World! \033[m"); <br>
                }<br>
            </div>

            <p>
                So, by merely printing a special sequence through stdout to the terminal, we have
                modified the state of the recipient terminal.
                A few notes:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li> <code>033</code> above is octal format, with decimal equivalent 27. </li>
                <li> This "setting" is persistent (try omitting the trailing <code>\033[m</code> ) </li>
                <li> To send an escape sequence from the keyboard, type CTRL+V, then ESC.  You should see <code>^[</code></li>
                <li> Why can't you just type <code>^[</code>?  <a href="http://unixwiz.net/techtips/termios-vmin-vtime.html"> Don't ask.</a> </li>
            </ol>


            <p>
                <a href="http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences-vt-100.php"> There are often dozens of such escaped sequences</a>,
                including such novelties as "set smooth scroll"; most real terminals can even change fonts.
                Some escape sequences may take parameters such as coordinates.
                In this case, the parameters
                <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-8.html#ss8.3">become part of</a> the escape sequence.

            <h2> Shell </h2>
            <p>
                Typically, when "interacting" with a computer, data from a tty file is read by a particular program called
                a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Command-line_shell"> shell</a>.
                There are many variants, such as the antiquated <code>sh</code>, its modern successor <code>bash</code>,
                the disused <code>csh</code>, the feature-laden <code>zsh</code>, and a relative newcomer, the Friendly Interactive Shell, <code>fish</code>.
                Each of these are ordinary programs, and exist within a running operating system as an ordinary
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)">user-space processes</a>; they have no special attributes or permissions.
                They simply read from a file (which might or might-not be your tty file), interpret and execute commands.
                The commands they "know" are determined <i>by the shell itself</i>, and can be determined by looking at
                the <code>PATH</code> environment variable:
            </p>

            <div class="code">
                echo $PATH
            </div>

                <h4> Aside </h4>
                <p>
                    Desktop environments serve a role analagous to shells, but in GUI-based environments.
                    In fact, they are sometimes called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)#GUI">Graphical Shells</a>.</i>
                    My favorite is Cinnamon!  Which one is yours?

            </div>

            <p>
                Shells are customizable in a variety of ways.
                Here we'll take a look at customizing the prompt in Bash.
                The prompt is the short string printed before the shell asks you for input.
                It usually looks like,
            </p>

            <div class="code">
            -->
        </div>

        <p>
            or perhaps,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            josh@home:~$
        </div>

        <p>
            Within Bash, the prompt is determined by the contents of the <code>PS1</code> variable.
            That is, Bash is, in some sense, an interpreted language, and has variables;
            among these is <code>PS1</code>.
            Each time Bash wishes to ask you for a new command, it reads and prints <code>PS1</code>
            before doing so.  Nothing more, and nothing less.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thus, we can modify the prompt by setting PS1 to our liking:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            PS1="-->"
        </div>

        <p>
            Everybody has their own thing&ndash; I prefer a simple and readable terminal experience.
            So, I wish the prompt to print my current working directory, in bold, so as to distinguish it from
            other lines.
        </p>

        <p>
            You might have guessed that what we're going to do is tell Bash to print
            an ANSI escape sequence saying, "Turn bold on," followed by the
            current working directory (another variable within Bash),
            followed by the ANSI escape sequence turning bold back off:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            PS1="\033[1m$PWD\033[m"
        </div>

        <p>
            Finally, we append an indicator telling us whether we are root user or not, along with a space:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            PS1="\033[1m$PWD\$\033[m "
        </div>

        <p>

            <h2> Terminal Line Discipline </h2>

            <p>
                For all text terminals, bytes flow from the keyboard to the computer, and bytes flow from the computer to the screen.
                In particular, bytes do not flow directly from the keyboard to the terminal's monitor;
                the reflection of typed characters on-screen is a function of the computer itself,
                and not a function of the terminal.
                We can shut off this functionality by the following:
            </p>

            <p>
                From the shell,
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                stty -echo
            </div>

            <p>
                Or, in a Posix-conforming environment,
            </p>

            <div class="code">
                #import &lt;termios.h&gt;<br>
                <br>
                [...]<br>
                <br>
                // Turn off echo, so typed user input does not show up<br>
                assert( tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &term) >= 0 );<br>
                term.c_lflag &amp;= ~ECHO;<br>
                assert( tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSANOW, &term) >= 0 );<br>
            </div>

            <p>
                Both of the above examples manipulate a very important C <code>struct</code>
                called <i>termios</i>.
                The termios struct belongs to the kernel; specifically, it belongs to a
                kernel module called the <i>terminal line discipline</i>.
                All characters which pass through a terminal device file
                pass through the terminal line discipline;
                the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html">termios struct</a> is how we manipulate its behavior, and thus,
                the behavior of keypresses.
            </p>

            <div class = "aside-left">
                <h4> Aside: X Window System </h4>
                The X Window System serves a role roughly analgous to the terminal line discipline:
                It facilitates the interaction between mouse, keyboard and monitors with application programs,
                though it exists in user-space rather than kernel-space.
                It is <i>server</i> it controls system resources,
                and provides an interface for other programs to interact with<sup><a href="#references">[14]</a></sup>.
            </div>

            <p>
                To explain, we start at the root. All keyboards send
                <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO-2.html">scancodes</a>
                to the computer. These are received and interpreted by a terminal
                device driver, yielding <i>keycodes</i>.  Then, within the same driver, are usually converted to ASCII.
            </p>

            <p>
                This information is then passed on to our terminal line discipline.
                The examples above modify the terminal line discipline's default
                behavior by manipulating the termios struct (indirectly in the first case,
                and directly in the second case).
                The default behavior is what is present at a shell prompt, and is intended
                to allow reasonable line-wise input by humans; it is called "canonical" or "cooked"
                mode, as opposed to "raw" mode (in which the terminal line discipline
                does nothing).
            </p>

            <p>
                This information, once it has been passed to the terminal line discipline,
                is then sent to a <code>tty</code> file, where a program can access
                it by reading the file.  The terminal line discipline is
                positioned exactly between the keyboard's hardware driver and
                each program's read/write system call.
                This allows it to intercept character combinations, such as
                CTRL+S and CTRL+D, map them
                to non-characters, and send the information (called <i>signals</i>)
                to the appropriate place.
            </p>

            <p>
                The termios struct is often manipulated by text-based programs,
                for instance, to turn off line-buffering and generate an interactive program.
                A common library for facilitating this is <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/intro.html">NCURSES</a>.
                Its sister libraries <code>panel</code>, <code>menu</code> and <code>form</code> provide an extension to the basic curses library.

            <h2>Signals</h2>
            <p>
                Signals are like escape sequences, but in the other
                direction.  That is, they
                are sent from the terminal (keyboard) to the computer, rather than
                being sent from the computer to the terminal.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are eleven Posix-defined special
                characters<sup><a href="#references">[15]</a></sup>, and most of them
                can be remapped by manipulating the <code>termios</code> struct.
                For instance, the CTRL+S combination is often mapped to the STOP special character;
                upon receiving the input bound to this special character, the terminal line
                discipline stops, and attempts to store, all data to and from the terminal.
                This can make it appear as though the terminal has frozen, but it has not.
                Neither input nor output is discarded; pressing CTRL+Q (START) will send all queued input and output where
                it's supposed to go, and then resume normal operation.
            </p>

            <p>
                This particular signal was more useful in times' past: The effect of STOP was to pause scrolling.
                In addition, the bell character was traditionally sounded when output was stopped and the terminal
                line discipline's buffer became full, thereby warning the user that data was being discarded.
                From the command prompt, we can list all bindings to special characters, in addition to other terminal attributes by,
