    <p>
        A <em>package</em> is a logical unit of software.
        The obvious example is a program, but libraries are packages, too.
        Packages may exist in either source-code or precompiled form.
        The purpose of this article is to orient the user to the package-centric
        landscape of pragmatic open-source software.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="open-source">
    <h2>Open Source</h2>

    <p>
        The GNU GPL stipulates that licensed software be available in source-code
        form. The GNU-way of building and installing their stuff is:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        # ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
    </div>

    <p>
        Each project uses its own language and build system;
        the above
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Lists.html#Lists">list</a>
        of commands presupposes C/C++ source built via
        GNU's <em>Autoconf.</em>
        Most packages include a <code>README</code> file of
        instructions to build, install, or tinker.
    </p>

    <p>
        The traditional UNIX package format is a compressed tarball, a file
        ending in <code>.tar.xz</code>, or <code>.tar.gzip</code>.
        One extracts such an archive with:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ tar xf kernel-5.10.tar.xz
    </div>

    <p>
        yielding a directory reflective of its original packager's.
    </p>

    <p>
        Naturally, the system may be viewed as a collection of installed
        packages.
        Finally, to configure and compile source code into usable software
        is to <em>build</em> it.

    <h2>Building an OS from Source</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            A new version of the documentation is released about every six months.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        <a href="http://linuxfromscratch.org/">Linux From Scratch</a> is
        documentation describing how to build a working
        GNU/Linux system entirely from source.
        One obtains 88 different packages, and goes about configuring,
        compiling and installing them by hand.
    </p>

    <p>
        Open-source is all about choice, and for some,
        Linux from Scratch is the only way to go.
        However, building anything from source is time-consuming and labor-intensive;
        in particular, feature and security updates are left entirely to the user.
        The ordinary user is not expected to build software from source.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a step towards automating this process, we might
        notice that <em>building</em> is per-package specific.
        Hence, we could maintain instructions of how to build packages, to
        be interpretted by some utility program.
    </p>

    <p>
        Gentoo Linux is an operating system built around this idea.
        The mechanized instructions to build software are kept in
        <code>ebuild</code>'s&mdash; Bash scripts which
        additionally describe where to obtain source code.
        These are interpretted by utilities on the user's machine,
        and <a href="https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/functions/">following them</a> 
        results in a new package being installed.
    </p>

    <p>
        The scheme is minimal, transparent and flexible, and Gentoo is all about
        openness and choice.<sup><a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/About">[a]</a></sup>
        Compilation remains time-consuming: It can take over a day
        to build a working system, but nonetheless begins to be
        approachable by ordinary users.

<div id="binary-packages" class="content">
    <h2> Binary Packages </h2>

    <p>
        Packages are usually distributed in preconfigured and precompiled form.
        This yields a smaller archive, saves users the
        time-consuming step of compilation, and allows the
        complete automation of installation.
        And software installation is fast!
        The implication, however, is that each package is configured
        for a particular operating system, and compiled for a 
        particular CPU architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
        Among major distributions, the Slackware Project entertains the
        oldest, and possibly simplest, binary packaging scheme.
        By modern standards, it may be considered crude,
        because it leaves dependency resolution to the user.<sup><a href="https://www.slackbook.org/html/package-management.html">[2]</a></sup>
        It is easily dissected, though, and so represents a nice example
        for us.
    </p>

    <p>
        A Slackware package arrives to the user as a compressed tarball.
        In this file is a directory tree reflective of the Slackware operating
        system, such as:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ tree slackware-vim-fake <br>
        . <br>
        ├── install <br>
        │   ├── doinst.sh <br>
        │   └── slack-desc <br>
        └── usr <br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;├── bin <br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;│   └── vim <br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;├── doc <br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;│   └── vim <br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;│   &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;├── COPYING <br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;│   &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;└── README <br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;└── man <br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;└── man1 <br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;└── vim.1.gz
    </div>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>
            The <code>install</code> directory is otherwise ignored.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        To install the package, the archive is extracted and each file
        is copied into its respective directory of the host operating system;
        if a directory does not exist, it is created.
        After these files are copied, the script
        <code>./install/doist.sh</code> is executed, if it exists.
    </p>

    <p>
        ...And that's it!
    </p>

    <p>
        The installation utility is, in this case, either
        <a href="https://www.slackbook.org/html/package-management-package-utilities.html"><code>installpkg</code> or <code>pkgtools</code></a>.
        It must be granted root privilege.
    </p>

    <p>
        All major distributions deal in binary packages, and use similar
        compressed-archives of "reflective directory trees,"
        though each to their own taste.
        By and large, however, the <em>package</em> is intended to be
        an opaque data format, and we will not dissect it further.

<div class="content" id="package-managers">
    <h2> Package Managers </h2>

    <p>
        A utility that obtains and installs packages is referred to as a
        <em>package manager.</em>
        Package managers are distribution-specific, and serve
        as the users' interface to their repositories.
        To name a few:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Debian: <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)">apt</a></code></li>
        <li>Fedora: <code><a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/rawhide/system-administrators-guide/RPM/">rpm</a></code></li>
        <li>openSUSE: <code>zypper</code></li>
        <li>Arch: <code>pacman</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Modern package managers are among the most powerful pieces of software
        on GNU/Linux operating systems.
        To update a machine utilizing Debian's packaging facilities, for example,
        we simply,
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ sudo apt update <br>
        $ sudp apt upgrade
    </div>

    <p>
        Searching for packages does not require superuser privileges:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ apt search vim
    </div>

    <p>
        Each package contains a description of itself:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ apt show vim
    </div>

    <p>
        And can be installed with:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ sudo apt install vim
    </div>

<div class="content" id="distributions">
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Distributions</h2>
    <h4>and Distribution Models</h4>

    <p>
        A <em>distribution</em> is a project and community that 
        obtains open-source software, configures, compiles and assembles 
        it into useable packages, and makes the results 
        publicly available.
        Along the way, they define overarching system practices, within
        which their packages will fit.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Here we are adopting the view that distributions focus
            primarily on package propogation, rather than operating systems.
            This view is implemented very directly in Arch Linux.
            For example, the package <code><a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/filesystem/">filesystem</a></code>
            creates the system's root directory tree,
            and initializes the system's core configuration files.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        There are many successful methods of package distribution.
        The <em>regular release</em> model deals in discrete
        package sets: 
        Packages are first composed into a working whole, 
        then undergo some testing period.
        The collection is then released publicly, at which point
        updates are restricted to bug fixes and security updates.
        New features do not become available within a 
        particular release.
        The set is supported for some length of time&mdash; 
        <em>Long-Term Support</em> releases are often maintained for
        five years.
    </p>

    <p>
        Distributions following the regular release model:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Linux Mint </li>
        <li> openSUSE Leap </li>
        <li> Debian </li>
        <li> Slackware </li>
        <li> Fedora </li>
        <li> Ubuntu </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The <em>rolling release</em> model dispenses with any 
        versioning scheme.
        Instead, software is distributed in its "latest stable" form,
        so that updates and features become available 
        to users as they are released by developers.
        The result is access to cutting-edge software&mdash;
        and a constant stream of updates.
    </p>

    <p>
        This strategy is growing in popularity, 
        especially among desktop users.  
        Examples:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Arch </li>
        <li> openSUSE Tumbleweed </li>
        <li> Garuda </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Between the two is the <em>semi-rolling release,</em>
        best explained through example:
        <a href="https://getsol.us/home/">Solus Linux</a> is an
        up-and-coming distribution focusing on the home computing.
        They publish updated packages every Friday, which,
        taken together, forms their latest release.
