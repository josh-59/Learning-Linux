	<h1> Terminals and Shells</h1>
	<h4>Under Construction! </h4>
	<p>
		Unix was born in the years immediately following punch-card
		machines.
		At the time, the preferred interface for users was the <a href="./text-terminals.html">physical terminal</a>.
		Although physical terminals are antiquated, the idea persists in
		modern contexts because it is a very good low-level interface to the machine:
		It is often used by developers and system administrators to quickly get work done.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="history" class="content">
	<h1>History</h1>
	<h4>Physical Terminals</h4>

	<p>
		As interactive computing became more popular, hard-copy terminals were phased out in favor of
		screen-based entities.
		The resulting devices, referred to as <i>text terminals,</i> consisted of a monitor and a keyboard;
		the monitor was unlike a modern monitor in that it contained a buffer
		(on the order of a few kilobytes<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[3]</a></sup>)
		which maintained the text currently on screen, and in that it contained a character-to-bitmap font table to be referenced
		when drawing each character; that is, it included its own font.
	</p>

	<p>
		A <i>physical terminal</i> is a computer peripheral similar to a typewriter.
		The earliest examples printed output onto paper, and were therefore
		nearest to typewriters.
		Later variants stored these characters in an onboard buffer, and
		displayed them on a screen.
	</p>

	<div class="aside-right">
		<h4>Aside:</h4>
		<p>
			In contrast to a modern monitor, a physical terminal
			can only display characters, and receives a description of the characters to display only once.
		</p>

		Second, the technological state of the 1960's included the <a href="https://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tel/teletype.htm"<i>teletypewriter</i></a>,
		a device for sending telegrams.
		These were, essentially, remote-controlled typewriters, and in the 1960's, they were repurposed to
		interface with computers.
		The resulting abstraction formed the basis of the input/output mechanism of early interactive computing.
		Paper-based terminals persisted well into the 1970's, and later electronic typewriters
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-u4kUeIqDI">sometimes support "terminal mode,"</a>
		allowing them to interface with computers via serial cable.

		The computer itself was not required to draw each character on-screen; that was the responsibility of
		the terminal.
		Rather, the mainframe was only expected to tell the terminal <i>which</i> characters to draw, once.
		Users would sit at a terminal, connected to a (possibly distant) machine, would type in
		programs, issue commands, enter data, etc.; a serial cable connected this I/O device to the computer,
		and it was termed a <i>terminal,</i> since it was located at the terminal end of this cable.

		Physical terminals <a href="https://www.vt100.net/dec/vt_history">were used for decades,</a>
		especially in situations mandating multiple access to large databases, such
		as libraries.
	</p>

	<p>
		It's worth noting that the idea of mainframe-driven utility computation suggests that the computer's organization
		follows the sctructure of a mathematical tree:
		The "root user" would sit at the root of this tree, exercising super-user priveledges over the machine,
		while end-users would be positioned at the leaves of the tree.

	<h2> Terminals </h2>
	<p>
		Terminals persist on modern hardware in the form of <i>terminal emulators</i>.
		These are user-space processes that, well, emulate an old terminal!
		Specifically, they provide a GUI front-end to a
		typewriter-style, line-by-line interface.

	<p>
		These emulators are "dumb", in the sense that they do nothing except

		Per tradition, the Unix environment presents these connections as files.
		Since they are emulating a device, we can expect to find them in

	<p>
		Virtual terminals are the closest re-imaging of the classic terminal-bound
		interface to be found in modern operating systems.
		They are full-screen terminal displays on the system video monitor,
		and are accessible by pressing the key combination CTRL+ALT+F[1-9]
		(use CTRL-ALT+F7 to get back!).
		You may log in to different virtual terminals simultaneously,
		and thus have a few different sessions with the computer going on at the same time.
		In the example below, 'josh' (me) owns the second virtual terminal
		(in fact, it's because I'm signed in there!).

		Virtual terminals are more than just a throwback to multiuser operating
		system days:  They allow access to the machine
		without a graphical user interface and, in particular, without the associated
		software (namely, without a window server, window manager, and desktop environment).
		In modern desktop GNU/Linux distributions, it is often the case that
		GUI-based systems software is merely an additional front-end layer to command-line tools
		(a common example is the
		<a href="https://www.nongnu.org/synaptic/"> Synaptic Package Manager</a>).
		That is, the command-line interface usually offers more and finer control over
		the machine, through less and more robust software.
		Virtual terminals are still highly relevant within the context of server applications.
	</p>

	<p>
		The user of a modern GNU/Linux distribution running a GUI is usually logged into the
		seventh virtual terminal, <code>/dev/tty7</code>.
		For completeness' sake, we will briefly explore how it is that the system arrives in this
		state.
		At the end of the kernel's boot sequence, the kernel launches a single
		user-space process with root permissions<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[7]</a></sup>
		<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[8]</a></sup>
		(commonly, <i><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd">systemd</a></i>).
		This process then launches the local window system, which, in turn, logs in at
		an empty virtual terminal.
		This process is almost always X Window Server, and it logs in to <code>tty7</code>,
		and launches the graphical user interface<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[9]</a></sup>.
		One can emulate this sequence by logging into a virtual terminal and launching
		the system's window server by, for instance, <code>sudo startx</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<code>/dev/tty0</code> is a somewhat special virtual terminal device because it is
		a synonym for the current virtual terminal.
		That is, if you are currently looking at the seventh virtual terminal, <code>tty7</code>, then data sent to <code>tty0</code>
		is sent to <code>tty7</code> (and not any other terminal).
		<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/60641/linux-difference-between-dev-console-dev-tty-and-dev-tty0">
			This unix.stackexchange answer</a> provides a great explanation, and a demonstration.
		</p>

		<h3>The Controlling Terminal:<br> /dev/tty </h3>
		<p>
			<code>/dev/tty</code> is a handle to the process's current tty device, if it exists<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[10]</a></sup>.
			It is, effectively, a process-specific file: Any process that is connected to a terminal
			may access its terminal here
			<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[11]</a></sup>.
		</p>

		<h4> Demonstration </h4>
		<ol>
			<li> Open up two terminal emulators</li>
			<li> Navigate each to <code>/dev</code></li>
			<li> In each, confirm that <code>tty</code> exists, is a character device, and has universal write permissions</li>
			<li> In each, confirm that writing to <code>tty</code> (e.g. <code>echo "stuff" > tty</code>) does not write to the other </li>
		</ol>

		<h3> Pseudoterminals: <br>pts/ </h3>
		<p>
			From
			<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.4/admin-guide/devices.html#terminal-devices"> Kernel.org Documentation</a>,
			"Pseudoterminals are used to create login sessions or provide other capabilities
			requiring a TTY line discipline to arbitrary data-generation processes."
			Pseudoterminals have no physical devices connected; rather, they are
			intended to pipe information through the kernel's terminal line discipline
			by connecting two distinct points in the file system,
			a <i>master</i>, <code>/dev/ptmx</code>, and a
			<i>slave</i>, a file with an integral filename, found in <code>/dev/pts</code>.
		</p>

		<div class="aside-right">
			<h4> Aside </h4>
			<p>
				Historically, there have been
				<a href="https://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-2.html">many names for terminal devices.</a>
				This essay develops <i>terminal</i> exclusively, for the sake of
				clarity and relevance in the modern domain.
				The only other synonym in common usage is "console," as in, "<i><code>/dev/tty1</code>
					through <code>/dev/tty7</code> are virtual consoles</i>
					<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[12]</a></sup>."
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				A user-space process opens the "master" side, <code>/dev/ptmx</code>,
				as an ordinary file.
				The kernel responds by returning a new file descriptor,
				and also by creating a new <i>slave</i> device file in <code>/dev/pts</code>.
				The process can then call <code>ptsname(int fd)</code>, passing the file
				descriptor given by opening the master side, whereby the kernel will return
				the pathname to the corresponding slave (terminal) device file.
			</p>

			<p>
				At this point, the process can treat the slave side of the pipe
				as a tty device, and the kernel will modify the stream as
				appropriate.
				The most common use of pseudoterminals is by terminal emulator programs.
				See <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/4/ptmx"> man 4 ptmx </a> and
				<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/ptsname"> man 3 ptsname </a>
				for more information.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are a lot of things you can do with pseudoterminals, and studying
				them goes a long way towards understanding the Unix filesystem concept.
				What you're doing is, you're piping a stream of characters through the kernel,
				and requesting that the kernel modify this stream in a way peculiar to
				a kernel module called the "terminal line discipline."
				We'll get into more detail about the terminal line discipline in the
				next section.
			</p>

			<h4> Demonstration </h4>
			<ol>
				<li> Open exactly two terminal emulators</li>
				<li> Navigate one to <code>/dev/pts</code></li>
				<li> List the directory contents and note its entries (should be nonempty)</li>
				<li> For each integral entry, write a string to the file, (e.g., <code>echo hello &gt; 2</code>) </li>
			</ol>


			<h3> System Console: <br><code>/dev/console</code> </h3>
			<p>
				This is the superuser's device.
				Kernel errors and other messages are sent here<sup><a href=#references style="text-decoration: none">[12]</a></sup>, and the device
				is owned entirely by the root user:
			</p>

			<div class="code">
				$ ls -lF /dev/console<br>
				crw------- 1 root root 5, 1 Mar 31 05:33 /dev/console
			</div>

		</div>





		<div id="shells" class="content">
			<h2> Shells </h2>

			<p>
				  A shell is a program which interprets and executes our (arbitrary) commands;
				  it is a <em>shell</em> in the sense that it is the outermost layer of the
				  operating system, the one which the user has direct contact.
				  Unix deviates from most operating systems designs by entertaining
				  the shell as an ordinary user-space process:  From a software
				  architecture standpoint, it is just a running program.
			 </p>

			 <p>
				  As depicted so far, it might appear that the shell exists "within" the terminal,
				  but that is not the case, and it's a mistake to adopt that sentiment.
				  Rather, the shell exists as a separately executing program, and <em>writes</em> to
				  the terminal as though it were a file.
				  Moreover, the shell gathers your input by <em>reading</em>
				  from the terminal as though it were a file.
				  This is possible because of the uniquely elegant file interface that
				  was created for Unix.
			</p>

			<p>
				Typically, when "interacting" with a computer, data from a tty file is read by a particular program called
				a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Command-line_shell"> shell</a>.
				There are many variants, such as the antiquated <code>sh</code>, its modern successor <code>bash</code>,
				the disused <code>csh</code>, the feature-laden <code>zsh</code>, and a relative newcomer, the Friendly Interactive Shell, <code>fish</code>.
				Each of these are ordinary programs, and exist within a running operating system as an ordinary
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)">user-space processes</a>; they have no special attributes or permissions.
				They simply read from a file (which might or might-not be your tty file), interpret and execute commands.
				The commands they "know" are determined <i>by the shell itself</i>, and can be determined by looking at
				the <code>PATH</code> environment variable:
			</p>

			<div class="code">
				$ echo $PATH
			</div>

			<div class="aside-right">
				<h4> Aside </h4>
				<p>
					Desktop environments serve a role analagous to shells, but in GUI-based environments.
					In fact, they are sometimes called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)#GUI">Graphical Shells</a>.</i>
					My favorite is Cinnamon!  Which one is yours?
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				Shells are customizable in a variety of ways.
				Here we'll take a look at customizing the prompt in Bash.
				The prompt is the short string printed before the shell asks you for input.
				It usually looks like,
			</p>

			<div class="code">
				-->
			</div>

		<p>
			or perhaps,
		</p>

		<div class="code">
			josh@home:~$
		</div>

		<p>
			Within Bash, the prompt is determined by the contents of the <code>PS1</code> variable.
			That is, Bash, in addition to being an interactive program, is an interpreted language, and has variables;
			among these is <code>PS1</code>.
			Each time Bash wishes to ask you for a new command, it reads and prints <code>PS1</code>
			before doing so.  Nothing more, and nothing less.
		</p>

		<p>
			Thus, we can modify the prompt by setting PS1 to our liking:
		</p>

		<div class="code">
			PS1="-->"
		</div>

		<p>
			Everybody has their own thing&ndash; I prefer a simple and readable prompt.
			So, I wish the prompt to print my current working directory, in bold, so as to distinguish it from
			other lines.
		</p>

		<p>
			You might have guessed that what we're going to do is tell Bash to print
			an ANSI escape sequence saying, "Turn bold on," followed by the
			current working directory (another variable within Bash),
			followed by the ANSI escape sequence turning bold back off:
		</p>

		<div class="code">
			PS1='\033[1m$PWD\033[m'
		</div>

		<p>
			This will work correctly on any terminal supporting ANSI escape sequences (which is most, if
			not all, of them).
			However, there's one "gotcha," that, well, got me:
			<code>bash</code> requires that each sequence of non-printing characters be wrapped in
			<code>\[</code> and <code>\]</code> (or else <code>bash</code> will allow text to wrap around
			in a very perplexing manner).
			So, we have:
		</p>

		<div class="code">
			PS1='\[\033[1m\]$PWD\[\033[m\]'
		</div>

		<p>
			Thanks Derek Taylor of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg">
			DistroTube</a>, for helping me out!
			Finally, we append an indicator telling us whether we are root user or not, along with a space:
		</p>

		<div class="code">
			PS1='\033[1m$PWD\$\033[m '
		</div>

		<p>
			Note single quotes!
			See the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.pdf">
				GNU Bash Reference Manual</a> ("Controlling the Prompt") for more information.

		<div id="standard-file-descriptors" class="content">
		  <h2> The Standard File Descriptors </h2>
		  <p>
		    Each process on a *nix system is created with three open files,
		    <em>Standard In,</em> <em>Standard Out</em> and <em>Standard Error:</em>
		  </p>

		  <figure>
		    <a href="assets/img/stdin-stdout-stderr.png"><img src="assets/img/stdin-stdout-stderr.png" style="width: 100%;"></a>

		  <div class="aside-right">
		    <h4>Aside:</h4>
		    <p>
		      Although these files are opened for every process,
		      we interact with them most often at the command line.
		    </p>
		  </div>

		  <p>
		    By default the shell connects each command-line utility's standard-in to
		    the keyboard, and both standard out and standard error to the terminal screen.
		    These are, in fact, the shell's <em>own</em> connections; each
		    process that the <a href="processes.html#proccess-creation">shell creates</a>
		    inherits the shell's file descriptors.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    Consider the <em>echo</em> utility.
		    This program reads each argument passed to it, and prints each to standard
		    out:
		  </p>

		  <div class="code">
		    $ echo one two three <br>
		    one two three <br>
		  </div>

		  <p>
		    Here, neither STDIN nor STDERR are used (although they are open).
		    Rather, the arguments are passed to the kernel during the
		    <em><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(pathname, argv, envp)</a></em>
		    system call, which places them within the address space of <em>echo</em>,
		    which in turn simply reads them from within itself and prints them to (its) standard out:
		  </p>

		  <figure>
		    <a href="assets/img/echo-std.png"><img src="assets/img/echo-std.png" style="width: 80%;"></a>
		  </figure>

		  <p>
		    The name <em>argv</em> is short for <em>argument vector,</em> and
		    is a pointer to an array of character pointers.<sup><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup>
		    It exists within each process, and the first element it points to
		    is always the name of the called program.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    We turn back to the operation of the shell.
		    As each line is read by the shell, it is broken down into tokens, which
		    are delimited by space(s) or tab(s).
		    The first token (here, '<code>echo</code>') is always interpreted as a command.
		    The other tokens were interpreted as arguments, so that our call to echo
		    passed three arguments.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    By default, the shell connects each command-line utility <em>Standard-out</em>
		    to the terminal screen, <em>Standard-in</em> to the keyboard, and
		    <em>Standard-error</em> to the  We can change this, though:
		  </p>

		    standard-out of the <code>echo</code> utility to a file called <code>boo</code> by using
		    the redirection operator <code>&gt;</code>.
		    This is a facility of the shell; <code>echo</code> is not involved in any way.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    To explain, in the command above, the shell first opens
		    the file <code>boo</code>, creating it if it does not exist, and truncating it
		    to zero length if it does exist (and is writeable).
		    Then the shell connects its own standard out to it, and executes echo.
		    Echo blindly prints its output to <em>standard out,</em> which happens to
		    be the file <em>boo</em>, and not the terminal screen.

			<h2>Special Characters</h2>

			<p>
				Terminal special characters are like escape sequences, but in the other
				direction.  They are key-combinations typed at the keyboard
				which are interpreted by the terminal driver and mapped to special
				actions.
				There are sixteen commonly mapped terminal special characters;<sup><a href="#references">[15]</a></sup>
				most of them can be remapped by manipulating the <code>termios</code> struct.
				Here are a few:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>CTRL-C&mdash; Send the interrupt signal, <code>SIGINT</code>, to the foreground process. This is the principal
					means of terminating an unresponsive process.</li>
				<li>CTRL-D&mdash; Write the End-of-File character, <code>EOF</code>, to
					standard-in of the foreground process.  This will terminate a Bash session,
					for instance, or an interactive Python session.</li>
				<li>CTRL-S&mdash; "<code>STOP</code>" Upon receiving this character combination, the terminal
					driver stops, and attempts to store, all data to and from the terminal.
				This can make it appear as though the terminal has frozen.</li>
				<li>CTRL-Q&mdash; "<code>START</code>" Restart terminal input and output.
					If input or output is queued, the terminal driver will send it first, then resume normal operation.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<em>Start</em> and <em>Stop</em> were more useful in times' past: The effect was to pause scrolling.
				In addition, the bell character was traditionally sounded when output was stopped and the terminal
				line discipline's buffer became full, thereby warning the user that data was being discarded.
				From the command prompt, we can list all bindings to special characters, in addition to other terminal attributes by,
			</p>

				$ stty -a

			<h2> Terminal Line Discipline </h2>

			<p>
				For all text terminals, bytes flow from the keyboard to the computer, and bytes flow from the computer to the screen.
				In particular, bytes do not flow directly from the keyboard to the terminal's monitor;
				the reflection of typed characters on-screen is a function of the computer itself,
				and not a function of the terminal.
				We can shut off this functionality by the following:
			</p>

			<p>
				From the shell,
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				$ stty -echo
			</div>

			<p>
				Or, in a Posix-conforming environment,
			</p>

			<div class="code">
				#import &lt;termios.h&gt;<br>
				<br>
				[...]<br>
				<br>
				// Turn off echo, so typed user input does not show up<br>
				assert( tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &term) >= 0 );<br>
				term.c_lflag &amp;= ~ECHO;<br>
				assert( tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSANOW, &term) >= 0 );<br>
			</div>

			<p>
				Both of the above examples manipulate a very important C <code>struct</code>
				called <i>termios</i>.
				The termios struct belongs to the kernel; specifically, it belongs to a
				kernel module called the <i>terminal line discipline</i>.
				All characters which pass through a terminal device file
				pass through the terminal line discipline;
				the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html">termios struct</a> is how we manipulate its behavior, and thus,
				the behavior of keypresses.
			</p>

			<div class = "aside-left">
				<h4> Aside: X Window System </h4>
				<p>
					The X Window System serves a role roughly analgous to the terminal line discipline:
					It facilitates the interaction between mouse, keyboard and monitors with application programs,
					though it exists in user-space rather than kernel-space.
					It is <i>server</i> it controls system resources,
					and provides an interface for other programs to interact with<sup><a href="#references">[14]</a></sup>.
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				To explain, we start at the root. All keyboards send
				<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO-2.html">scancodes</a>
				to the computer. These are received and interpreted by a terminal
				device driver, yielding <i>keycodes</i>.  Then, within the same driver, are usually converted to ASCII.
			</p>

			<p>
				This information is then passed on to our terminal line discipline.
				The examples above modify the terminal line discipline's default
				behavior by manipulating the termios struct (indirectly in the first case,
				and directly in the second case).
				The default behavior is what is present at a shell prompt, and is intended
				to allow reasonable line-wise input by humans; it is called "canonical" or "cooked"
				mode, as opposed to "raw" mode (in which the terminal line discipline
				does nothing).
			</p>

			<p>
				This information, once it has been passed to the terminal line discipline,
				is then sent to a <code>tty</code> file, where a program can access
				it by reading the file.  The terminal line discipline is
				positioned exactly between the keyboard's hardware driver and
				each program's read/write system call.
				This allows it to intercept character combinations, such as
				CTRL+S and CTRL+D, map them
				to non-characters, and send the information (called <i>signals</i>)
				to the appropriate place.
			</p>

			<p>
				The termios struct is often manipulated by text-based programs,
				for instance, to turn off line-buffering and generate an interactive program.
				A common library for facilitating this is <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/intro.html">NCURSES</a>.
				Its sister libraries <code>panel</code>, <code>menu</code> and <code>form</code> provide an extension to the basic curses library.

		<div id="escape_sequences" class="content">
			<h2> Escape Sequences </h2>
			<p>
				It's worth repeating at this point that the terminal <i>proper</i> only sends a stream of bytes, and
				merely receives a stream of bytes.
				That is, the only method of sending data to a terminal monitor is by the same channel as
				printable characters.
				As a consequence, it is necessary to establish some common standard for communicating to the terminal
				non-printable, or <i>control</i>, characters, such as "newline."
				In the US, printable characters were traditionally mapped via ASCII (with the exception of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC"> some early IBM mainframes</a>).
				The first 32 ASCII characters (decimal 0 through 31) are control characters, rather than printable.
				They include the famous bell character, and both tab and newline (aka, "linefeed");
				in order to delete previously written text, one can print the backspace
				character, decimal 8 (see <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ascii.7.html"> man ascii </a> for more information).
			</p>

			<p>
				Most of these control characters quickly became antiquated, so that the majority are not widely used.
				For instance, ASCII alone does not provide provisions for moving the cursor or scrolling.
				As a consequence, the more extensible mechanism of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequence">escape sequences</a> was developed.
				The sequences in use were soon standardized by ANSI, and their support became ubiquitous.
				Each of these sequences begins with the ASCII "escape" control character (decimal 27)
				and the left-bracket "<code>[</code>" printable<sup><a href="#references">[13]</a></sup>.
				They are sequences of entirely ASCII characters.
				Technically, the're terminal-specific, but are still viable today
				because modern emulators typically
				<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/43945/whats-the-difference-between-various-term-variables">implement a superset</a>
				of older terminals' escape sequences.
				Within C, to print <i>Hello World!</i> in reverse, we could do
			</p>

			<div class="code">
				#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>
				<br>
				int main() {<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;printf("\033[7m Hello World! \033[m"); <br>
				}<br>
			</div>

			<p>
				So, by merely printing a special sequence through stdout to the terminal, we have
				modified the state of the recipient terminal.
				A few notes:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li> <code>033</code> above is octal format, with decimal equivalent 27. </li>
				<li> This "setting" is persistent (try omitting the trailing <code>\033[m</code> ) </li>
				<li> To send an escape sequence from the keyboard, type CTRL+V, then ESC.  You should see <code>^[</code></li>
				<li> Why can't you just type <code>^[</code>?  <a href="http://unixwiz.net/techtips/termios-vmin-vtime.html"> Don't ask.</a> </li>
			</ol>


			<p>
				<a href="http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences-vt-100.php"> There are often dozens of such escaped sequences</a>,
				including such novelties as "set smooth scroll"; most real terminals can even change fonts.
				Some escape sequences may take parameters such as coordinates.
				In this case, the parameters
				<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-8.html#ss8.3">become part of</a> the escape sequence.
