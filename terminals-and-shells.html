    <p>
        The shell does little else.  
        It may provide some means to store variables, and offer to expand them, 
        but by and large, shells are as "dumb" as terminals, and, this is intentional.

        Different operating systems have their own idioms for the command line.
        The UNIX way 
    </p>


    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
        For example,
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ git clone https://
    </div>

    <p>
        and
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ cargo build
    </div>

    <p>
        both contain subcommands, whereas
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ ls -F
    </div>

    <p>
        contains an option.
    </p>

    <p>
        This convention is not strictly adhered to, but is worthwhile.
        Formally:
    </p>

        
    <p>
        Where <code>command</code> is mandatory and arguments are optional.
    </p>

    ================>Closing Remarks<=================

    <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
    <p>
        Arguments from the command line are passed to each program as it 
        begins execution, and each language has facilities to inspect them.
        In C, they are presented as arguments to the <em>main</em> function:
    </p>

    <pre>
        int main(char** argv, int argc) 
                        ^^^^
    </pre>

    <p>
        where <code>argv</code> denotes a vector of strings, and <code>argc</code>
        is a count of them.
        <code>argv[1]</code> denotes the first argument, 
        <code>argv[2]</code> denotes the second, etc.
        Effectively, arguments are the glue between the shell interface
        and preferential program execution.
    </p>

    <p>
        A parent can pass information to its child in other ways,
        such as environment variables, but 
        ...and tend to remain constant over a session.

        Though foreign to most users, the text-terminal is the original
        interface for "interactive computing." 
        This article will examine the fascinating theory of terminals and shells in 
        GNU/Linux, and, in so doing, indirectly justify their persistence on
        modern hardware.

	<h2 style="margin-bottom: 2pt;">Physical Terminals</h2>
	<h4>A Brief History</h4>

	<p>
		A <i>physical terminal</i> was a computer peripheral similar to a typewriter.
		The earliest examples printed output onto paper;
		this technology was carried over from the
		<a href="https://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tel/teletype.htm"<i>teletypewriter</i></a>,
		a device for sending telegrams.
		Paper-based terminals persisted well into the 1970's; later
        electronic typewriters sometimes supported terminal mode,
		allowing them to interface with computers via serial cable.

	</center>

	<p>
		As technology developed and interactive computing became more popular,
		hard-copy terminals were phased out in favor of
		screen-based entities.
		The resulting devices consisted of a monitor and keyboard.
		The monitor was unlike a modern monitor in that it contained a buffer
        (on the order of a few kilobytes<sup><a href="https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-1.html#ss1.6">[2]</a></sup>)
		which maintained the text currently on screen.
		In addition, it contained a font table to be referenced
		when drawing each character&mdash; that is, it included its own font.
	</p>

	<p>
		Physical terminals <a href="https://www.vt100.net/dec/vt_history">were used for decades,</a>
		especially in situations demanding multiple access to large databases, such
		as airlines and libraries.
		In such situations, the computational infrastructure forms a tree,
		with the system's administrators at the root, and end-users at
        the leaves.

	<h2> Terminal Emulators </h2>
	<p>
		Terminals persist on modern hardware in the form of <i>terminal emulators</i>.
		These are user-space processes that, well, emulate an old terminal!
		Specifically, it is a program that runs within the context of a desktop 
        environment, and emulates the functionality of a physical terminal.

		<p>

	</div>

	<p>
		These emulators are "dumb" in the sense that they do nothing except
		display text and return text.
		Per tradition, GNU/Linux presents terminal connections as files.
		Since they are emulating a device, we can expect to find them in
		<code>/dev</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Terminals can become quite involved; for this introduction, and for
        most purposes, it is sufficient to recognize that
		terminals and shells are distinct, cooperating processes.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="shells" class="content">
	<h2> Shells </h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
		<h4>Aside:</h4>
		<p>
		    <a href="https://itsfoss.com/what-is-desktop-environment/">
                Desktop environments</a>
            serve a role analogous to shells.
		<p>
	</div>

	<p>
		A shell is a program which interprets and executes our (arbitrary) commands.
		It is a <em>shell</em> in the sense that it is the outermost layer of the
		operating system, and the one which the user has direct contact.
	</p>

    <p>
		The UNIX architecture entertains the shell as an ordinary user-space process:
        From its perspective, it is just another running program.
        This allows a single operating system to support many shells.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some modern shells:
	</p>

	<ul style="list-style: none;">
		<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a>&mdash; A GNU Production, pretty much the standard shell</li>
		<li><a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/">Zsh</a>&mdash; A shell "designed for interactive use; very similar to Bash.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.nushell.sh/">Nushell</a>&mdash; An interactive shell, supporting piplines of structured data, in addition to simple text streams.</li>

            in Python.</li>
		<li><a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a>&mdash; The Friendly Interactive Shell</li>
	</ul>

    <p>
        A shell is launched for you when a terminal emulator window is opened:
    </p>

    <figure>
		<img src="assets/img/gnome-w-bash.png">
		<figcaption><center>GNOME Terminal Emulator running Bash</center></figcaption>
	</figure>

    <p>
        You can find out which shell is running
        by executing the <code>ps</code> command:
    </p>

    <figure>
		<img src="assets/img/gnome-w-bash-ps.png">
		<figcaption><center><code>ps</code> command, by default listing processes owned by this user, connected to this terminal </center></figcaption>
	</figure>

    <p>
        Finally, note that we will typically omit the picture of the terminal,
        so that the above command will be depicted:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ ps <br>
        PID &ensp;TTY   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;TIME CMD <br>
        3142 pts/1   00:00:00 bash <br>
        3148 pts/1   00:00:00 ps
    </div>

</div>

<div class="content" id="commands">
    <h2>Commands</h2>

    <p>
        A typical line of input to a shell has the following form: 
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ <i>command</i> [arg ...]
    </div>

    <p>
        This corresponds directly to <em>execute another program</em> named
        <code>command</code>, and pass it the arguments in <code>[arg ...]</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The shell, for its part, finds the program,
        forks itself and executes that command.
        This is canonical shell behavior, and all programs that can be implemented 
        in this manner are.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, one might expect the highly shell-centric command <code>ls</code>
        to be built in to the shell, and in lesser constructs, that would
        be the case.
        In fact, <code>ls</code> exists as <code>/usr/bin/ls</code>, and the
        shell dutifully locates and executes it each time we ask to 
        see a directory's contents.
        Similar remarks apply to any command that does something, be it
        <em>move a file,</em> <em>delete a directory,</em> or <em>view the
        system's processes.</em>
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            If you're not interested in our command-line, don't worry: 
            <a href="intro-to-gnu-linux.html#mint">Distributions exist</a> 
            that don't require its use.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The result is a highly programmer-centric paradigm.
        To create a new command just became very simple: Put your 
        program in a location that the shell will look, and then you may
        execute it natively, as though it had been there all
        along&mdash;
        No need to rebuild the shell.
    </p>

    <h3 style="width: 30%; margin: auto;">In the Beginning</h3>

    <p>
        The first working versions on UNIX entertained exactly two processes, 
        one for each of two terminals connected to the machine.<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html">[3]</a></sup>
        The shell, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_shell"><code>sh</code></a>, 
        existed as a user-space process, but <em>fork()</em> had not been introduced.
        To execute a different program, the shell simply replaced itself with 
        the requested program; 
        the program, on calling <em>exit</em>, replaced itself with the 
        shell once again.<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html">[3]</a></sup>

<div class="content" id="path">
    <h2><code>PATH</code> Environment Variable</h2>

    <!--
        Kernighan page 132:
            Invented by John Mashey and introduced in the 6th edition shell,
            it was a workaround so that non-expert users could
            share their own sets of commands by lab, department and group.
    -->

    <p>
        The <code>PATH</code> environment variable 
        contains a list of directories to be searched 
        when looking for a command.
        This list is colon (<code>:</code>)&ndash;separated, and may look like,
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ echo $PATH<br>
        /usr/bin:/bin:/home/josh/.local/bin
    </div>

    <p>
        The shell searches each directory in this list from left to right
        for a file whose name matches the command given. 
        It executes the first found, and then abandons its search.
    </p>

    <!--
    <p>
        The PATH environment variable was invented by John Mashey and 
        introduced in the 6th edition shell.
        It was a workaround so that non-expert users could
        share their own sets of commands by lab, department and group.
    </p>
    -->


    <p>
        Some caveats apply:
        If the command is a builtin, Bash will execute the builtin, and ignore
        <code>PATH</code>.
        More, Bash does <em>not</em> search the current working directory for a command.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can overrule both builtins and the shell's search of PATH 
        including a forward-slash <code>/</code> in our command, typically:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ ./<i>command</i>
    </div>

    <p>
        Appending locations to <code>PATH</code> is an important step of 
        setting up a development environment.
        This is typically done in <code>~/.bashrc</code>.
        The correct construct appends the directory
        only if it is not already present:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        if [[ ! $PATH =~ $HOME/.local/bin ]]; then<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin<br>
        fi

<div class="content" id="pwd">
    <h2>Working Directory</h2>

    <p>
        Recall that each process has a 
        <a href="/processes.html#process-attributes">current working directory</a>.
        Since the shell is a process, naturally, it too has a current working directory.
        At the command line, this is of particular importance:
        It reflects <em>where you are</em> in the directory tree.
    </p>

    <p>
        The shell's current working directory may be printed with the 
        command <code>pwd</code>:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ pwd<br>
        /home/josh
    </div>

    <p>
        Its value may be changed with <code>cd</code>:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ cd Public<br>
        $ pwd<br>
        /home/josh/Public
    </div>

    <h3><code>cd</code> is a builtin</h3>

    <p>
        In Ancient UNIX, <em>change directories</em> was implemented
        as a separate command.
        When invoked, it inherited the shell's current working directory,
        changed it, and then the shell would inherit <em>that</em> working directory.
        With the inclusion of the <em>fork()</em> system call, though, 
        the <code>chdir</code> command broke:

    <!--
        Justification: https://qmacro.org/2020/11/08/the-meaning-of-pwd-in-unix-systems/
    -->

    <p>

    <blockquote>
        "There was much reading of code and anxious introspection about how 
        the addition of fork could have broken the chdir call. Finally the 
        truth dawned: in the old system chdir was an ordinary command; it 
        adjusted the current directory of the (unique) process attached to
        the terminal. Under the new system, the chdir command correctly 
        changed the current directory of the process created to execute it, 
        but this process promptly terminated and had no effect whatsoever on 
        its parent shell! It was necessary to make chdir a special command,
        executed internally within the shell. It turns out that several 
        command-like functions have the same property, for example login."
