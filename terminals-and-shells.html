	<h1> Terminals and Shells</h1>
	<h4>Under Construction! </h4>
	<p>
		Unix was born in the years immediately following punch-card
		machines.
		At the time, the preferred interface for users was the <a href="./text-terminals.html">physical terminal</a>.
		Although physical terminals are antiquated, the idea persists in
		modern contexts because it is a very good low-level interface to the machine:
		It is often used by developers and system administrators to quickly get things done.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="history" class="content">
	<h2 style="margin-bottom: 2pt;">History:</h2>
	<h4>Physical Terminals</h4>

	<p>
		A <i>physical terminal</i> is a computer peripheral similar to a typewriter.
		The earliest examples printed output onto paper;
		this technology was carried over from the
		<a href="https://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tel/teletype.htm"<i>teletypewriter</i></a>,
		a device for sending telegrams.
		Paper-based terminals persisted well into the 1970's, and later electronic typewriters
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-u4kUeIqDI">sometimes support terminal mode,</a>
		allowing them to interface with computers via serial cable.

	<p>
		As technology developed and interactive computing became more popular,
		hard-copy terminals were phased out in favor of
		screen-based entities.
		The resulting devices consisted of a monitor and keyboard.
		The monitor was unlike a modern monitor in that it contained a buffer
		(on the order of a few kilobytes<sup><a href=#references>[3]</a></sup>)
		which maintained the text currently on screen.
		In addition, it contained a font table to be referenced
		when drawing each character&mdash; that is, it included its own font.
	</p>

	<p>
		Physical terminals <a href="https://www.vt100.net/dec/vt_history">were used for decades,</a>
		especially in situations demanding multiple access to large databases, such
		as airlines and libraries.
		In such a situation, the computational infrastructure forms a tree,
		with the system's administrators at the root, end-users at 
        the leaves.

	<h2> Terminals </h2>
	<p>
		Terminals persist on modern hardware in the form of <i>terminal emulators</i>.
		These are user-space processes that, well, emulate an old terminal!
		Specifically, they provide a GUI front-end to a
		typewriter-style, line-by-line interface:

	</p>

	<div class="aside-right">
		<h4>Aside:</h4>
		<p>
			The files we are interested in are <code>/dev/pts/*</code>
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		These emulators are "dumb", in the sense that they do nothing except
		display text and return text.
		Per tradition, the Unix environment presents these connections as files.
		Since they are emulating a device, we can expect to find them in
		<code>/dev</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Terminal emulation can become quite involved;
		for this introduction, and for most purposes, it is sufficient to recognize that
		terminals and shells are distinct, cooperating processes.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="shells" class="content">
	<h2> Shells </h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
		<h4>Aside:</h4>
		<p>
		    Desktop environment serve a role analogous to shells.
		<p>
	</div>

	<p>
		A shell is a program which interprets and executes our (arbitrary) commands;
		it is a <em>shell</em> in the sense that it is the outermost layer of the
		operating system, and the one which the user has direct contact.
		Unix deviates from most operating systems designs by entertaining
		the shell as an ordinary user-space process:  From a software
		architecture standpoint, it is just another running program.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some modern shells:
	</p>

	<ul style="list-style: none;">
		<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a>&mdash; A GNU Production; the standard shell</li>
		<li><a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/">zsh</a>&mdash; A shell designed for interactive use</li>
		<li><a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a>&mdash; The Friendly Interactive Shell</li>
	</ul>

    <p>
        Learning to use a shell amounts to learning how it handles
        each command given to it.  
        Here we'll study <code>bash</code>, but note that other shells
        in Linux operate similarly.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="decomposing-lines">

    <h4>aka "Parsing"</h4>

</div>

<div class="content" id="command-location">
    <h2>Commands and Builtin's</h2>

    <p>
		It is often valuable to know how <code>bash</code> searches
        for programs.
        Most commands that users enter into a shell are separate programs.
        For instance, when a user enters,
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ ls
    </div>

    <p>
        the shell finds the <code>ls(1)</code> executable, forks itself, and
        instructs the child process to execute that binary. 
        The <code>ls</code> program then reads its current directory's
        entries and prints them out.
        The shell 
        <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/wait.2.html">waits</a>
        until <code>ls</code> terminates, then returns with a prompt.
        This happens very quickly.
    </p>

     <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Alternative:</h4>
        <p>
            <code><a href="https://the.exa.website"</a>exa</a></code>
            is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        While this strategy is certainly preferrable, there are times 
        where it will not work.
        For instance, changing the current directory must be carried out 
        by <code>bash</code> itself, since it is a per-process attribute.
        Commands such as these are called <em>builtins</em>, and can be
        listed by,
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ help
    </div>

    <p>
        Where <code>help</code> is, itself, a builtin.
    </p>

	</div>
</div>


	<div id="standard-file-descriptors" class="content">
		<h2> The Standard File Descriptors </h2>
		<p>
			Each process on a *nix system is created with three open files,
			<em>Standard In,</em> <em>Standard Out</em> and <em>Standard Error:</em>
		</p>

		<figure>
			<a href="assets/img/stdin-stdout-stderr.png"><img src="assets/img/stdin-stdout-stderr.png" style="width: 100%;"></a>
		</figure>


		<div class="aside-right">
			<h4>Aside:</h4>
			<p>
				Although these files are opened for every process,
				we interact with them most often at the command line.
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			By default the shell connects each command-line utility's standard-in to
			the keyboard, and both standard out and standard error to the terminal screen.
			These are, in fact, the shell's <em>own</em> connections; each
			process that the <a href="processes.html#proccess-creation">shell creates</a>
			inherits the shell's file descriptors.
		</p>

		<p>
			Consider the <em>echo</em> utility.
			This program reads each argument passed to it, and prints each to standard
			out:
		</p>

		<div class="code">
			$ echo one two three <br>
			one two three <br>
		</div>

		<p>
			Here, neither STDIN nor STDERR are used (although they are open).
			Rather, the arguments are passed to the kernel during the
			<em><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(pathname, argv, envp)</a></em>
			system call, which places them within the address space of <em>echo</em>,
			which in turn simply reads them from within itself and prints them to (its) standard out:
		</p>

		<figure>
			<a href="assets/img/echo-std.png"><img src="assets/img/echo-std.png" style="width: 80%;"></a>
		</figure>

		<p>
			The name <em>argv</em> is short for <em>argument vector,</em> and
			is a pointer to an array of character pointers.<sup><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup>
			It exists within each process, and the first element it points to
			is always the name of the called program.
		</p>

		<p>
			We turn back to the operation of the shell.
			As each line is read by the shell, it is broken down into tokens, which
			are delimited by space(s) or tab(s).
			The first token (here, '<code>echo</code>') is always interpreted as a command.
			The other tokens were interpreted as arguments, so that our call to echo
			passed three arguments.
		</p>

		<p>
			By default, the shell connects each command-line utility <em>Standard-out</em>
			to the terminal screen, <em>Standard-in</em> to the keyboard, and
			<em>Standard-error</em> to the  We can change this, though:
		</p>

		<div class="code">
			$ echo one two three > boo <br>
		</div>

		<p>
			This is called <em>redirection</em>&mdash; Formally, we have redirected the
			standard-out of the <code>echo</code> utility to a file called <code>boo</code> by using
			the redirection operator <code>&gt;</code>.
			This is a facility of the shell; <code>echo</code> is not involved in any way.
		</p>

		<p>
			To explain, in the command above, the shell first opens
			the file <code>boo</code>, creating it if it does not exist, and truncating it
			to zero length if it does exist (and is writeable).
			Then the shell connects its own standard out to it, and executes echo.
			Echo blindly prints its output to <em>standard out,</em> which happens to
			be the file <em>boo</em>, and not the terminal screen.
		</p>

	<div id="special-characters" class="content">
		<h2>Special Characters</h2>

		<p>
			Terminal special characters are like escape sequences, but in the other
			direction.  They are key-combinations typed at the keyboard
			which are interpreted by the terminal driver and mapped to special
			actions.
			There are sixteen commonly mapped terminal special characters;<sup><a href="#references">[15]</a></sup>
			most of them can be remapped by manipulating the <code>termios</code> struct.
			Here are a few:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>CTRL-C&mdash; Send the interrupt signal, <code>SIGINT</code>, to the foreground process. This is the principal
				means of terminating an unresponsive process.</li>
				<li>CTRL-D&mdash; Write the End-of-File character, <code>EOF</code>, to
					standard-in of the foreground process.  This will terminate a Bash session,
					for instance, or an interactive Python session.</li>
					<li>CTRL-S&mdash; "<code>STOP</code>" Upon receiving this character combination, the terminal
						driver stops, and attempts to store, all data to and from the terminal.
						This can make it appear as though the terminal has frozen.</li>
						<li>CTRL-Q&mdash; "<code>START</code>" Restart terminal input and output.
							If input or output is queued, the terminal driver will send it first, then resume normal operation.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							<em>Start</em> and <em>Stop</em> were more useful in times' past: The effect was to pause scrolling.
							In addition, the bell character was traditionally sounded when output was stopped and the terminal
							line discipline's buffer became full, thereby warning the user that data was being discarded.
							From the command prompt, we can list all bindings to special characters, in addition to other terminal attributes by,
						</p>

						<div class="code">
							$ stty -a
						</div>

						<p>
							Hope you enjoyed this&mdash; more to come!
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="terminal_line_discipline" class="content">
						<h2> Terminal Line Discipline </h2>

						<p>
							For all text terminals, bytes flow from the keyboard to the computer, and bytes flow from the computer to the screen.
							In particular, bytes do not flow directly from the keyboard to the terminal's monitor;
							the reflection of typed characters on-screen is a function of the computer itself,
							and not a function of the terminal.
							We can shut off this functionality by the following:
						</p>

						<p>
							From the shell,
						</p>
						<div class="code">
							$ stty -echo
						</div>

						<p>
							Or, in a Posix-conforming environment,
						</p>

						<div class="code">
							#import &lt;termios.h&gt;<br>
							<br>
							[...]<br>
							<br>
							// Turn off echo, so typed user input does not show up<br>
							assert( tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &term) >= 0 );<br>
							term.c_lflag &amp;= ~ECHO;<br>
							assert( tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSANOW, &term) >= 0 );<br>
						</div>

						<p>
							Both of the above examples manipulate a very important C <code>struct</code>
							called <i>termios</i>.
							The termios struct belongs to the kernel; specifically, it belongs to a
							kernel module called the <i>terminal line discipline</i>.
							All characters which pass through a terminal device file
							pass through the terminal line discipline;
							the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html">termios struct</a> is how we manipulate its behavior, and thus,
							the behavior of keypresses.
						</p>

						<div class = "aside-left">
							<h4> Aside: X Window System </h4>
							<p>
								The X Window System serves a role roughly analgous to the terminal line discipline:
								It facilitates the interaction between mouse, keyboard and monitors with application programs,
								though it exists in user-space rather than kernel-space.
								It is <i>server</i> it controls system resources,
								and provides an interface for other programs to interact with<sup><a href="#references">[14]</a></sup>.
							</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							To explain, we start at the root. All keyboards send
							<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO-2.html">scancodes</a>
							to the computer. These are received and interpreted by a terminal
							device driver, yielding <i>keycodes</i>.  Then, within the same driver, are usually converted to ASCII.
						</p>

						<p>
							This information is then passed on to our terminal line discipline.
							The examples above modify the terminal line discipline's default
							behavior by manipulating the termios struct (indirectly in the first case,
							and directly in the second case).
							The default behavior is what is present at a shell prompt, and is intended
							to allow reasonable line-wise input by humans; it is called "canonical" or "cooked"
							mode, as opposed to "raw" mode (in which the terminal line discipline
							does nothing).
						</p>

						<p>
							This information, once it has been passed to the terminal line discipline,
							is then sent to a <code>tty</code> file, where a program can access
							it by reading the file.  The terminal line discipline is
							positioned exactly between the keyboard's hardware driver and
							each program's read/write system call.
							This allows it to intercept character combinations, such as
							CTRL+S and CTRL+D, map them
							to non-characters, and send the information (called <i>signals</i>)
							to the appropriate place.
						</p>

						<p>
							The termios struct is often manipulated by text-based programs,
							for instance, to turn off line-buffering and generate an interactive program.
							A common library for facilitating this is <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/intro.html">NCURSES</a>.
							Its sister libraries <code>panel</code>, <code>menu</code> and <code>form</code> provide an extension to the basic curses library.

					</div>

					<div id="escape_sequences" class="content">
						<h2> Escape Sequences </h2>
						<p>
							It's worth repeating at this point that the terminal <i>proper</i> only sends a stream of bytes, and
							merely receives a stream of bytes.
							That is, the only method of sending data to a terminal monitor is by the same channel as
							printable characters.
							As a consequence, it is necessary to establish some common standard for communicating to the terminal
							non-printable, or <i>control</i>, characters, such as "newline."
							In the US, printable characters were traditionally mapped via ASCII (with the exception of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC"> some early IBM mainframes</a>).
							The first 32 ASCII characters (decimal 0 through 31) are control characters, rather than printable.
							They include the famous bell character, and both tab and newline (aka, "linefeed");
							in order to delete previously written text, one can print the backspace
							character, decimal 8 (see <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ascii.7.html"> man ascii </a> for more information).
						</p>

						<p>
							Most of these control characters quickly became antiquated, so that the majority are not widely used.
							For instance, ASCII alone does not provide provisions for moving the cursor or scrolling.
							As a consequence, the more extensible mechanism of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequence">escape sequences</a> was developed.
							The sequences in use were soon standardized by ANSI, and their support became ubiquitous.
							Each of these sequences begins with the ASCII "escape" control character (decimal 27)
							and the left-bracket "<code>[</code>" printable<sup><a href="#references">[13]</a></sup>.
							They are sequences of entirely ASCII characters.
							Technically, the're terminal-specific, but are still viable today
							because modern emulators typically
							<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/43945/whats-the-difference-between-various-term-variables">implement a superset</a>
							of older terminals' escape sequences.
							Within C, to print <i>Hello World!</i> in reverse, we could do
						</p>

						<div class="code">
							#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>
							<br>
							int main() {<br>
								&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;printf("\033[7m Hello World! \033[m"); <br>
							}<br>
						</div>

						<p>
							So, by merely printing a special sequence through stdout to the terminal, we have
							modified the state of the recipient terminal.
							A few notes:
						</p>

						<ol>
							<li> <code>033</code> above is octal format, with decimal equivalent 27. </li>
							<li> This "setting" is persistent (try omitting the trailing <code>\033[m</code> ) </li>
							<li> To send an escape sequence from the keyboard, type CTRL+V, then ESC.  You should see <code>^[</code></li>
							<li> Why can't you just type <code>^[</code>?  <a href="http://unixwiz.net/techtips/termios-vmin-vtime.html"> Don't ask.</a> </li>
						</ol>


						<p>
							<a href="http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences-vt-100.php"> There are often dozens of such escaped sequences</a>,
							including such novelties as "set smooth scroll"; most real terminals can even change fonts.
							Some escape sequences may take parameters such as coordinates.
							In this case, the parameters
							<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-8.html#ss8.3">become part of</a> the escape sequence.
