To Do:
        <p>
        This article introduces the command line, and is intended to serve as
        down-the-road documentation.
        It explains shell behavior chronologically with respect to command execution,
        but can be read piecewise.
    </p>

    Terminal Pro:
        fork'ed == subshell environment
        $ type bash
        $ which bash
        $ file $(which bash)

    Shells:
    http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf
 Today, the way in which commands are executed by the shell can be summarized as follows: 1) The shell reads a command line from the terminal. 2) It creates a child process by fork.3) The child process uses exec to call in the command from a file. 4) Meanwhile, the parent shell uses wait to wait for the child (command) process to terminate bycalling exit.5) The parent shell goes back to step 1)

    Closing Remarks:
    Text Editor: vim

    These controls have made their way into many other programs: man, git, less.
    In fact, even Firefox lets you 'Quick Search' a web page with <code>/</code>.
    Once you are (well) familiar with them, you can set Bash to vi-mode with
    <code>set -o vi</code>.

            Most shells support <em>tab completion:</em>
            If you've typed enough of a command-name or filename to
            uniquely identify it, you can press "tab," and it will complete it for you.

	<h1> Terminals and Shells</h1>
	<h4>Under Construction! </h4>

    <p>
        IN THE BEGINNING, the shell operated in a simple loop involving an <em>exec</em>
        call to itself.<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html">[1]</a></sup>
        SINCE THE BEGINNING, times have been good, and bearded UNIX hackers 
        have been productive.
        In particular, per-user multiprocessing, and the <code>fork()</code> system call, have been introduced.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="physical-terminals" class="content">
	<h2 style="margin-bottom: 2pt;">Physical Terminals</h2>
	<h4>A Brief History</h4>

	<p>
		A <i>physical terminal</i> was a computer peripheral similar to a typewriter.
		The earliest examples printed output onto paper;
		this technology was carried over from the
		<a href="https://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tel/teletype.htm"<i>teletypewriter</i></a>,
		a device for sending telegrams.
		Paper-based terminals persisted well into the 1970's, and later 
        electronic typewriters sometimes supported terminal mode,
		allowing them to interface with computers via serial cable.
	</p>

		Ken Thompson (sitting) and Dennis Ritchie at PDP-11 in the "UNIX Room" of Bell Labs
	</center>

	<p>
		As technology developed and interactive computing became more popular,
		hard-copy terminals were phased out in favor of
		screen-based entities.
		The resulting devices consisted of a monitor and keyboard.
		The monitor was unlike a modern monitor in that it contained a buffer
		(on the order of a few kilobytes<sup><a href=#references>[3]</a></sup>)
		which maintained the text currently on screen.
		In addition, it contained a font table to be referenced
		when drawing each character&mdash; that is, it included its own font.
	</p>

	<p>
		Physical terminals <a href="https://www.vt100.net/dec/vt_history">were used for decades,</a>
		especially in situations demanding multiple access to large databases, such
		as airlines and libraries.
		In such situations, the computational infrastructure forms a tree,
		with the system's administrators at the root, and end-users at 
        the leaves.

<div id="terminal-emulators" class="content">
	<h2> Terminal Emulators </h2>
	<p>
		Terminals persist on modern hardware in the form of <i>terminal emulators</i>.
		These are user-space processes that, well, emulate an old terminal!
		Specifically, it is a program that runs within the context of a desktop environment,
		and emulates the functionality of a physical terminal.
	</p>

	</p>

	<div class="aside-right">
		<h4>Aside:</h4>
		<p>
			The files we are interested in are <code>/dev/pts/*</code>
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		These emulators are "dumb" in the sense that they do nothing except
		display text and return text.
		Per tradition, GNU/Linux presents terminal connections as files.
		Since they are emulating a device, we can expect to find them in
		<code>/dev</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Terminals can become quite involved; for this introduction, and for 
        most purposes, it is sufficient to recognize that
		terminals and shells are distinct, cooperating processes.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="shells" class="content">
	<h2> Shells </h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
		<h4>Aside:</h4>
		<p>
		    <a href="https://itsfoss.com/what-is-desktop-environment/">
                Desktop environments</a>
            serve a role analogous to shells.
		<p>
	</div>

	<p>
		A shell is a program which interprets and executes our (arbitrary) commands.
		It is a <em>shell</em> in the sense that it is the outermost layer of the
		operating system, and the one which the user has direct contact.
	</p>

    <p>
		The UNIX architecture entertains the shell as an ordinary user-space process:  
        From the operating system's perspective, it is just another running program.
        This allows a single operating system to support many shells.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some modern shells:
	</p>

	<ul style="list-style: none;">
		<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a>&mdash; A GNU Production, pretty much the standard shell</li>
		<li><a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/">Zsh</a>&mdash; A shell designed for interactive use; very similar to Bash.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.nushell.sh/">Nushell</a>&mdash; An interactive shell, supporting piplines of structured data, in addition to simple text streams.</li>
        <li><a href="https://elv.sh/">Elvish</a>&mdash; an "expressive programming language and versatile interactive shell." Version 1.0 not yet released</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/ion">ion</a>&mdash; The default shell of <a href="https://www.redox-os.org/">RedoxOS</a>, works on Linux as well</li>
		<li><a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a>&mdash; The Friendly Interactive Shell</li>
	</ul>

    <p>
        A shell is launched for you when a terminal emulator window is opened:
    </p>

		<figcaption><center>GNOME Terminal Emulator running Bash</center></figcaption>
	</figure>

    <p>
        You can find out which shell is running 
        from within terminal with the <code>ps</code> command:
    </p>

    <figure>
		<img src="assets/img/gnome-w-bash-ps.png">
		<figcaption><center><code>ps</code> command, by default listing processes owned by this user, connected to this terminal </center></figcaption>
	</figure>

    <p>
        Learning to use a shell amounts to learning how it handles
        commands given to it.  
        Here we'll study <code>bash</code>, but other shells
        in Linux operate similarly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, we will typically omit the picture of the terminal,
        so that the above command will normally be depicted:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ ps <br>
        PID &ensp;TTY   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;TIME CMD <br>
        3142 pts/1   00:00:00 bash <br>
        3148 pts/1   00:00:00 ps

<div class="content" id="simple-commands">
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Simple Commands</h2>
    <h4>and Word Splitting</h4>

    <p>
        A typical line of input given to the shell is as follows:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        command [arg1 arg2 ...] 
    </div>

    <p>
        Where <em>command</em> is mandatory, and arguments are
        optional.
        In the following example, the <code>ls</code> command is given
        with the single argument <code>-l</code>:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ ls -l
    </div>

    <p>
        Elements (referred to as "words") are separated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character">whitespace</a>.
        If, for some reason, we need to include whitespace in
        an argument, we can wrap said argument in single-quotes.
        There are a few ways to go about this, but 
        single quotes are most-used: 
        They tell Bash to preserve the text exactly as-is.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, in the following command, 
        the <code>cd</code> command recieves a single argument,
        <code>Random Acccess Memories</code>: 
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ cd 'Random Access Memories'
    </div>

    <p>
        In Bash, breaking a line of input into its elements is 
        known as <em>word splitting</em>, 
        and is the first step of command interpretation.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="content" id="pwd">
    <h2>Working Directory</h2>

    <p>
        Recall that each process has a <a href="/processes.html#process-attributes">current working directory</a>.
        Since the shell is a process, it naturally follows that it too has a current working directory.
        At the command line, this attribute is of particular importance:
        It reflects <em>where you are</em> in the system's directory tree.
    </p>

    <p>
        The shell's current working directory may be printed with the command <code>pwd</code>:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ pwd<br>
        /home/josh
    </div>

    <p>
        Its value may be changed with the <code>cd</code> command:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ cd Public/Learning-Linux<br>
        $ pwd<br>
        /home/josh/Public/Learning-Linux
    </div>

    <p>
        When UNIX was still a baby, <em>change directories</em> was implemented
        as a separate command.
        When invoked, it inherited the shell's current working directory,
        changed it, and then the shell would inherit <em>that</em> working directory.
        With the inclusion of the <em>fork()</em> system call, though, the <code>chdir</code>
        command broke:
    </p>


    <!--
        Justification: https://qmacro.org/2020/11/08/the-meaning-of-pwd-in-unix-systems/
    -->

    <p>

    <blockquote>
        "There was much reading of code and anxious introspection about how the addition of fork could 
        have broken the chdir call. Finally the truth dawned: in the old system chdir was an 
        ordinary command; it adjusted the current directory of the (unique) process attached to 
        the terminal. Under the new system, the chdir command correctly changed the current 
        directory of the process created to execute it, but this process promptly terminated and had 
        no effect whatsoever on its parent shell! It was necessary to make chdir a special command, 
        executed internally within the shell. It turns out that several command-like functions have 
        the same property, for example login."
    </blockquote>

    </div>

    <p>
        The <code>cd</code> command is also, necessarily, built in to the shell.
        Commands such as these are today called <em>builtins</em>, and can be investigated by:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ help [command]
    </div>

</div>

<div class="content" id="path">
    <h2><code>PATH</code> Environment Variable</h2> 
    <p>
        In the author's glorious opinion, <code>bash</code> has too many builtins.  
        Since builtins <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Search-and-Execution.html#Command-Search-and-Execution">take precedence</a> over external commands, 
        the effect is that the <code>which</code> command can, effectively, lie to the user.
        Combined with the fact that there is no builtin that serves the purpose of <code>which</code>, we arrive at a rare
        GNU/Linux snafu.
