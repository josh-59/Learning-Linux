        Programming can be a lucrative profession, and it also makes
        a wonderful hobby.
        It is not necessary to get a degree in computer science to
        land a job as a programmer:
        The rule of thumb is that two good projects are worth an
        entire CS degree.
        In this addendum, we will discuss what must and what should
        be learned to become an good programmer.

    <h2>Languages</h2>

    <p>
        There are a bazzillion programming languages in use today,
        and you're free to do whatever you want.
        Some people find sport in writing programs in the language
        <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a>,</em> 
        a language intentionally obtuse (to the extreme).
        I'm only going to cover three languages: 
        Two that I think you must know, and one that I think should know.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Pro Tip:</h4>
        <p>
            Ignore C++
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The C programming language is the <em>lingua franca</em> of 
        computing, and any developer worth their salt knows their 
        way around it.  
        As of this writing, it is being relegated to use at 
        the assembly level, with other languages replacing it for
        application development.
        Learning it will expose you to fundamental ideas in computing,
        such as memory addresses and numeric interpretation of bytes.
        The standard text for this language is 
        <em>The C Programming Language,</em>
        affectionately referred to as <em>K&R</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second language that is essential in the modern domain
        is Python. 
        Python is a powerful, general-purpose interpreted language,
        and makes a wonderful first language. 
        It's in wide use by the scientific community; 
        it's even available on the latest
        generation of TI-84 Graphing calculators!
    </p>

    <p>
        The final programming language worth learning (in my opinion)
        is <em>Rust</em>.
        The goal of the Rust team is to empower everyone to build
        reliable and efficient software.
        They have done this by creating a programming language that
        is fast and memory-safe.
        It's a great language, but it is not easy to learn!
        If you stumble through learning Rust as I did, try to
        keep in mind that <em>What you are doing is not simple.</em>

    <h2>Standard Courses</h2>

    <p>
        After learning a programming language or two,
        data structures are the next thing to learn in becoming 
        a developer.
        All modern standard libraries include smart implementations of
        common data structures, so that learning how they work is a 
        bit of an academic exercise&mdash; but worthwhile, for sure.
        The developer of today needs to know when to use what,
        but by and large, does not need to know their in's and out's.
    </p>

    <p>
        The best text on data structures that I have found is
        <a href="https://opendatastructures.org/">Open Data Structures</a>
        by Pat Morin.
        Advanced studies delve further into mathematics, 
        usually focusing on analysis of algorithms.
        The canonical text of algorithms is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition">Introduction to Algorithms</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Discrete Mathematics</h3>

    <p>
        Discrete mathematics is not a difficult subject,
        on par with a first semester in calculus.  
        It will introduce enough logic to give informal proofs, 
        cover graphs and advanced counting techniques, among other thinGiven the inherently discrete nature of the bit, this
        subject founds all of computer science.
        I liked <a href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html"> Discrete Mathematics - An Open Introduction</a>
    </p>
 
    <h3>Computer Architecture</h3>

    <p>
        Ah, computer architecture.  I loved studying this subject,
        but honestly wonder how useful it is.  
        It looks into the abstractions presented by
        hardware itself, such as signed and unsigned numbers, 
        and instruction set architectures.
        A good development of this
        material is highly mathematical.
        I liked <a href="http://www.csapp.cs.cmu.edu/">Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective</a>.

    <h3>Operating Systems</h3>

    <p>
        A very large topic, it
        discusses operating systems in the abstract.  
        A good, if lighthearted, development is given by 
        Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau in
        their free <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/"> Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces</a>.

        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            In two words: <em>Helper Functions!</em>
        </p>
    </div>


                Write code that can be improved.
                This just means that the developer's first responsibility
                is to keep the code simple.
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep it simple</li>
                </ul>
            </li>


    <p>
        Code is read much more often than it is written.
        As such, it is the responsibility of the developer to write
        code which can be read easily&mdash; that is, which is clear.
    </p>

    <p> 
        If you do wish to contribute a modification to a project, 
        then you have a few responsibilities:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Write code that can be read easily
                <ul>
                    <li>Code is read much more often than it is written</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
                       <li>
                Write code that is modular
                <ul>
                    <li>Account for future development</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        But most of all, do one thing and do it well.
    </p>
