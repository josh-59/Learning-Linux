    <h2>Gradual Improvement</h2>

    <p>
        Software development is fundamentally reiterative:
        Something is built, released, improved, then released again.
        Maintainers sometimes stage releases so that they may 
        be worked on jointly.
        The practice of improving a thing gradually is so important
        to the success of open-source that 
        This has often been phrased as <em>Do one thing and do it well.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Reiterative improvement
        "stability without stagnation."<sup><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html">[6]</a></sup>

    <p>

    <em><mark>
        The success of any project, with respect to producing a mature
        and polished product, is contingent principally 
        upon its improvement through long-term evolution.</mark></em>
        That is to say, the secret is, there is no secret.
    </p>
</div>



Questions:
    What is open source to you?  What does it mean?

    A fully-free operating system is a limit case of collaboration-based
    development.
	<p>
		Like any model, the above interpretation of the open-source ecosystem 
		loses some information.  
        In particular, I did not stress the modularity of successful
        commons-based peer production.
        My purpose in presenting it is not to explain the ecosystem 
        in exhaustive detail, but rather to highlight its most important 
        facets.
    </p>

    <p>
        Can the success of open-source be generalized? 
        That's what I really want to know.
    </p>

    <p>
        Interesting to note that the fundamental underlying quantity, 
        desire, is the same within the market economy and the open-source ecosystem.
        It has found a simpler, more direct outlet, through intrinsic motivation.
        It is also interesting to note that gratitude is neither required, nor
        even appropriate.  
        Thanking someone for doing what they want is a non sequitor; thanking
        Linus Torvalds for the Linux kernel would be like thanking someone for
        running six miles.
    </p>

    <p>
	    Dr. Steven Weber, Professor of Economics at University of California,
		Berkely, thinks so.
	aints a slightly different (though not inconsistent)
		picture of the open source ecosystem in his book, <em>The Success
		of Open Source.</em>
		In it, he isolates volutary participation and voluntary selection
		of tasks as pivotal in the open source process:
	</p>

    <blockquote>
        <em>The key element of the open source process, as an ideal type,
        is the voluntary participation and voluntary selection of
        tasks.</em>[sic]
        Anyone can join an open source project, and anyone can leave at
        any time.
        That is not just a free market in labor.  
        What makes it different from the theoretical option of exit
        from a corporate organization is this: Each person is free to
        choose what he wishes to work on or to contribute.
        There is no consciously organized or enforced division of labor.<sup><a href="#references" title="Weber">[1]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Yet another attempt to understand open-source's success
        by Harvard Law School professor Yochai Benkler
        yielded the term, "Commons-based peer production"
    </p>


    <p>
        "What is the purpose of an open-source project/community?
        Collaborate together as a group to maintain the project
        and honestly to also have fun.  [...]
        We want to keep the project going for various reasons,
        but you want to enjoy yourself while you do it.

        So what makes it all tick?
        In this exciting conclusion, we'll pick apart the
        key components of the open-source ecosystem,
        from the motivations of contributors to the leadership
        style necessarily implied by them.
    </p>

<div class="content" id="intrinsic-value">
    <h2>Intrinsic Value</h2>

    <p>
        Compared to the market economy we all know and love, 
        open source is a strange beast:
        Its works are created because what they 
        are <em>is</em> what their creators want.
        Stated another way, the intent of all free software is 
        the software itself.
        Such goods, produced for their own sake, are said
        to be <em>intrinsically motivated,</em> and 
        this, in turn, underpins the open-source ecosystem.
        Intrinsic motivation is found in many other places, 
        such as academic research; it's the reason you take out the
        trash, or plant flowers.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            We are not in the business of pleasing other people.
            We are in the 
            <em>"I have an itch and I'm gonna scratch it,"</em> business.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Contributing to open source can also make
        sound financial sense&mdash; Facebook 
        taking part in the development of 
        Linux's new
        <code><a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">btrfs</a></code> 
        is one such example.
        However, in this case, as in most other cases, 
        the principal interest is in the software <em>per se:</em>
        It is developed to be used, not to be sold, and is therefore
        developed for its intrinsic value.
    </p>

    <p>
        Admittedly, we are adopting a very high-level perspective of
        open-source.
        By analogy, money is the motivating entity of the market
        economy.
        At the macro perspective, this may hold true, yet it is certainly
        the case that individuals are often motivated by things
        like enjoyment, passion or idealism.
        Nonetheless, I believe that intrinsic value is the most important
        motivating force in the open-source ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
        If intrinsic value is indeed the principle motivating force
        of the open-source ecosystem, as I believe it is,
        then it would follow that those projects with
        the greatest number of use-cases garner the greatest support.
        In support of this, the largest free-software organization to date
        is neither GNU nor Linux, but the 
        <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache Foundation</a>, 
        whose projects underpin the world wide web.

    <h4>Modularity</h4>

    <p>
        GNU/Linux can be likened to a 500-piece puzzle with 2500 
        available pieces:
        For any piece of the puzzle&mdash; shell, desktop environment,
        web browser, right down to
        C libraries and
        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel">kernels</a>&mdash;
        there are around five competent options to choose from.
        Each option is someone's project, and is
        developed largely independantly of other projects.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            It is crucial that these projects remain small enough to 
            be manageable.
            This has been referred to as <em>granularity.</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        One of the truly remarkable things of modern 
        open source is that no one person or organization is solely
        responsible for the creation of 
        a GNU/Linux operating system.
        Rather, collecting and assembling the pieces 
        <em>is a project of its own,</em> distinct from, say, 
        shell development or kernel development.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This is an example of modularity, and it is
        left to the user to decide which component (collection)
        instantiates each needed piece (system).
        Modular construction lies 
        at the heart of GNU/Linux's success, and is 
        central to the Unix Philosophy:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "A serious attempt is made to apply the principle of modularity 
        to everything on a Unix-like system, not only programs but also 
        parts of programs, such as algorithms, and even the kernel. 
        Thus, a Unix-like operating system generally (or at least ideally)
        consists of a small kernel together with a large number of small, 
        specialized programs that can interact with each other through a 
        variety of well-defined interfaces."<sup><a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html">[5]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
        The independance of each project means that contributors 
        to the ecosystem work together in a highly parallel and 
        unstructured fashion.
        It allows each contributor to make the change they 
        desire without affecting others.
        The result is a largely decentralized method of production, with 
        relatively few authorities present. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="anatomy">
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Anatomy of a Project</h2>
    <h4>Community</h4>

    <p>
        Open-source projects are organized around
        a small group of maintainers&mdash; often, only one. 
        Maintainers present their project to the world, 
        offering new versions as they become mature, and
        have the ability to modify their work
        however they want.
        They accept user-born modifications as they see fit,
        and they can decline a proposed modification for any 
        reason whatsoever. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The maintainers and contributors of a project have a common,
        shared goal, and form a community.
        Apache Software Foundation member Ted Dunning explains:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "We as people come together; we have some communal interest.
        As such, we build a structure together that allows us to work
        together, allows us to communicate, allows us to bring in new people,
        and build software together.
        This is definitely not the fastest way to build software, but
        it's a remarkably sustainable way."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Especially about popular projects, 
        project leadership can become a matter of curating modifications.
        Very large projects, like the Linux kernel or the Firefox
        web browser, have been broken down into subsystems, which each 
        have maintainers of their own.
        The result is a tree, and user-born 
        modifications first
        pass through the appropriate subsystem maintainer 
        before being proposed to the project's overarching maintainer;
        it can be declined anywhere along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maintainers work diligently over years to present a
        polished product, and have earned the trust of the community.
        They are the most important people of open-source.
        An open source software project without a maintainer 
        is said to be <em>unmaintained.</em> 
        It has effectively been abandoned&mdash;
        or it is looking for a maintainer :) .

    <h4>A Success Story</h4>

    <p>
        A paging utility is a program that displays a file on 
        a terminal one screenful at a time.
        The first widely used paging utility was <code>more</code>, written by
        Dan Halbert as a graduate student at UC Berkeley in 1978.<sup><a href="https://danhalbert.org/more.html">[2]</a></sup>
        <code>more</code> is a simple program: It first 
        fills up the screen, then waits for user input to print the 
        next line(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1983, Mark Nudelman was a software developer working for a
        company called Integrated Office Systems. From the <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#history"><code>less</code> FAQ</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Some of our software ran on a Unix system and produced enormous log files
        of its transactions. We wanted to be able to search these log files for
        error messages. But the version of "vi" we were using couldn't handle
        files larger than a certain size, and our log files often exceeded that
        size. So we were forced to use "more" to view the files. The problem was,
        once we found an error message, what we really wanted to see was the
        transactions leading up to the error; that is, the lines in the log file
        immediately before the error message. But more didn't allow backward
        movement in the file.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        We often complained about this problem. We said we needed a "backwards
        more"; someone (it wasn't me, but unfortunately I don't remember who
        it was) coined the name "less" as a joke on the concept of a "backwards
        more". It didn't seem to me that it would be too difficult to write a
        simple pager that would allow forward and backward movement.
        I wrote the first version in late 1983 and we began using it internally.
        I continued to enhance it and finally decided it was a useful enough
        tool that I should make it available to the world. I posted the first
        version to the newsgroup called (at that time) net.sources in May, 1985.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Making the program publicly available allowed an enormous number of
        people to use it. Many people have made their own modifications and
        donated them to me for incorporation into the official version, and
        many more have reported bugs they've found or made suggestions about
        features they'd like to see added. This was my first experience with
        the concept of what is now called "open source" or "free software",
        and it has, I believe, produced a very high quality product. I'd like
        to thank all the users of less for their invaluable comments and
        suggestions over the years. 
        Less wouldn't be what it is today without you.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Mark Nudelman continues to maintain the project today.  
        It is, at the time of this writing, in its 581<sup>st</sup> 
        version.<sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#version">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/index.html">[4]</a></sup>
