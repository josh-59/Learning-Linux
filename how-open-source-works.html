    The full story of Open-Source altruism 
    https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/docs/2023-02-14-so-whats-next.md

    <p>
        Because they are pursuing the software itself, open-source developers are 
        naturally inclined to produce the best product they can. 
    </p>


    <h3>Not Just Software</h3>

    <p>
        I recently had the pleasure of chatting with a man who
        had built a memorial for fallen soldiers, just off a 
        popular multi-use trail.
        It was a small thing, maybe 15 feet by 15, but was well-cared
        for and contained two benches, an ornately paved deck, 
        a flagpole with lights and a memorial set in stone.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was interesting to see how much of the structure of an
        open-source project was reflected in his own volunteer work: 
        The man, Ernie, was a veteran of Vietnam, and had started his
        project ten years ago. He had with him a helper from his church,
        and they were preparing to add marble to flank the brick
        path.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>What it was</em> was motivating to him.
        More, we can see that it was not built overnight; we can see
        that the project was undertaken and carried out, principally,
        by a single man.  
        In this way, we can see that the above remarks apply not only
        to software, but to volunteer efforts more broadly.
    </p>

    <p>
        In our culture, we're accustomed to a simple get-what-you-pay-for
        attitude.  If you want nice things, the idea goes, then you can
        expect to pay handsomely for them.  
        But there is another way to obtain nice things, and that is
        by consistently improving upon what you've got.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Applied to the process itself, this would mean that the change
        I desire will not be realized overnight.  More, that the appropriate
        strategy would be to "pick away" at the world as it stands; to
        win one minor victory at a time.  More, smart money would be on
        producing those things that 1) Have value 2) Can be reproduced
        cheaply/in large quantities.  


    <blockquote>
        "What is the purpose of an open-source project/community?
        Collaborate together as a group to maintain the project
        and honestly to also have fun.  [...]
        We want to keep the project going for various reasons,
        but you want to enjoy yourself while you do it.

        In this exciting conclusion, we'll pick apart the

<div class="content" id="what-is">
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0">What is GNU/Linux?</h2>
    <h4>A collection of projects</h4>

    <p>
        GNU/Linux can be likened to a 500-piece puzzle with 2500 
        available pieces:
        For any piece of the puzzle&mdash; shell, desktop environment,
        web browser, right down to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library#Implementations">C libraries</a> and
        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel">kernels</a>&mdash;
        there are around five competent options to choose from.
    </p>

    <p>
        The operating systems built from these parts have a few
        characteristics in common:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Based around some variant of the Linux kernel; and, </li>
        <li>Utilizing GNU core utilities</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Technically, GNU/Linux is a "class" of operating system.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The modularity that exists through the "package" concept
        was neither planned nor intentional, but emerged
        as GNU/Linux matured into a fully capable platform.
        The package, and in turn the project, has become
        a central organizing feature of GNU/Linux.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many smallish projects allow users to shape their system 
        as they desire, allows
        contributors to promote modifications to a given part, 
        and allows developers to reasonably introduce a new 
        component, as they desire.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the remarkable things about GNU/Linux is that no one person
        (or organization, for that matter) is responsible for the production 
        of an entire operating system.
        Rather, collecting and assembling the parts <em>is a project of
        its own,</em> distinct from, say, shell development.

<div class="content" id="intrinsic-value">
    <h2>Intrinsic Value</h2>

    <p>
        Compared to the market economy we all know and love, 
        open source is a strange beast:
        Its works are created because what they 
        are <em>is</em> what their creators want.
        Stated another way, the intent of free software is 
        the software itself.  This differs from proprietary schemes, where the
        point of software is the profit it promises.
    </p>

    <p>
        Goods produced for their own sake are said
        to have <em>intrinsic value,</em> and 
        this, in turn, underpins open source.
        Intrinsic value is found in many places, 
        such as academic research and art on public display.
        It's the reason you take out the trash, go to the gym, or plant flowers.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Stated more plainly, we are not in the business of 
            pleasing other people. 
            We are in the <em>"I have an itch and I'm gonna scratch 
            it,"</em> business.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        It's easy to mistake contribution for altruism, but that would be,
        well, a mistake.
        Rather, the existence of a bug or the absence of a feature
        motivates modification, which then works its way into the
        appropriate project.
    </p>

    <p>
        Projects can attract commercial interests, as well. 
        <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/824855/">Facebook taking part</a> 
        in the development of Linux's new
        <code><a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">btrfs</a></code> 
        is one such example.
        But note that, in this case, as in most other cases, 
        the principal interest is in the software <em>per se:</em>
        It is developed to be used, not to be sold, and is therefore
        developed for its intrinsic value.
    </p>

    <p>
        If intrinsic value were indeed the principle motivating force
        of the open-source ecosystem, 
        it would follow that those projects with
        the greatest number of use-cases garner the greatest support.
        In support of this, note that the largest free-software 
        organization to date is neither GNU nor Linux, but the 
        <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache Foundation</a>, 
        whose projects underpin the world wide web.<sup><a href="https://www.apache.org/">[1]</a></sup>

    <h2>Anatomy of a Project</h2>

    <div class=aside-right>
        <h4>Aside</h4>
        <p>
            Although open-source canon states that every user is a 
            potential developer, in practice the majority of development 
            is thanks to a relatively small group of people.<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Open-source projects are typically organized around
        a small group of core developers, called maintainers.
        Maintainers have the ability to modify the work however
        they want, and accept user-born modifications as they see fit.
        Maintainers offer new versions as they become mature, and
        in so doing present the work to the world.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-left">
        <h4>Pro Tip:</h4>
        <p>
            You can judge the relative health of a project by how recently
            it's been modified.  More recently is better.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Maintainers work diligently over years to present a
        polished product to the world, and have earned the trust of the community;
        they are the most important people of open-source, and are
        the "owners" of their respective projects.<sup><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s04.html">[3]</a></sup>
        An open source software project without a maintainer 
        has effectively been abandoned&mdash;
        or it is looking for a maintainer :) .
    </p>

    <p>
        With a common, shared goal&mdash; the project itself&mdash; the 
        contributors to a project form a community. As Ted Dunning put it,
    </p>
 
    <blockquote>
        "We as people come together; we have some communal interest.
        As such, we build a structure together that allows us to work
        together, allows us to communicate, allows us to bring in new people,
        and build software together.
        This is definitely not the fastest way to build software, but
        it's a remarkably sustainable way."<sup><a href="#references">[4]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Especially about large and popular projects, 
        maintainership can become a matter of curating modifications.
        Very large projects (like the Linux kernel or the Firefox
        web browser) have been broken down into subsystems, 
        with each subsystem having maintainer(s) of their own.
        The result is that user-born 
        modifications first pass through the appropriate subsystem 
        maintainer before being proposed to the project's 
        overarching maintainers, before finally being accepted into the
        work itself.

    <h2>Continual Improvement</h2>

    <p>
        The components constituting a modern GNU/Linux system 
        were not created overnight, 
        but rather through a slow process of 
        elaboration and refinement.
        This gradual improvement is a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process">continual improvement process</a>, and
        follows a clear pattern: Deploy, study, improve, repeat.
    </p>

    <div class='aside-right'>
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            The Linux kernel, for example, gets re-released every six weeks.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        It may seem strange that a project would be released before it is 
        complete, but in practice software is never "finished."
        It can always be improved, and for proof of this, one must only
        look at the sequence of releases given by proprietary projects.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In practice, open-source software is given away for free,
        attracting users.  Since sources are available, interested
        parties can inspect its construction, and identify 
        areas that could be improved.  
        Their modifications generally, but not always, work their way back to
        source; under the guidance of maintainers, projects
        stay on course.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even marginal improvements accrue, and with each successive
        iteration, the software becomes better-able to serve its
        users.
        Large numbers of iterations see fantastic improvement, and
        results in products that are polished and whole.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maintainers generally prefer small improvements to
        radical ones&mdash;
        Bear in mind that they have probably
        been maintaining the work longer than you've been studying it.
        Individual improvements usually tackle one of two items:
        Bug fix or feature addition.

    <h4>A Success Story</h4>

    <p>
        A paging utility is a program that displays a file, 
        one screenful at a time.
        The first widely used paging utility was <code>more</code>, written by
        Dan Halbert as a graduate student at UC Berkeley in 1978.<sup><a href="https://danhalbert.org/more.html">[5]</a></sup>
        <code>more</code> is a simple program: It first 
        fills up the screen, then waits for user input to print the 
        next lines.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1983, Mark Nudelman was a software developer working for a
        company called Integrated Office Systems. From the <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#history"><code>less</code> FAQ</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Some of our software ran on a Unix system and produced enormous log files
        of its transactions. We wanted to be able to search these log files for
        error messages. But the version of "vi" we were using couldn't handle
        files larger than a certain size, and our log files often exceeded that
        size. So we were forced to use "more" to view the files. The problem was,
        once we found an error message, what we really wanted to see was the
        transactions leading up to the error; that is, the lines in the log file
        immediately before the error message. But more didn't allow backward
        movement in the file.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        We often complained about this problem. We said we needed a "backwards
        more"; someone (it wasn't me, but unfortunately I don't remember who
        it was) coined the name "less" as a joke on the concept of a "backwards
        more". It didn't seem to me that it would be too difficult to write a
        simple pager that would allow forward and backward movement.
        I wrote the first version in late 1983 and we began using it internally.
        I continued to enhance it and finally decided it was a useful enough
        tool that I should make it available to the world. I posted the first
        version to the newsgroup called (at that time) net.sources in May, 1985.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Making the program publicly available allowed an enormous number of
        people to use it. Many people have made their own modifications and
        donated them to me for incorporation into the official version, and
        many more have reported bugs they've found or made suggestions about
        features they'd like to see added. This was my first experience with
        the concept of what is now called "open source" or "free software",
        and it has, I believe, produced a very high quality product. I'd like
        to thank all the users of less for their invaluable comments and
        suggestions over the years. 
        Less wouldn't be what it is today without you.
