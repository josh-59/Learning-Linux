<!--

    <p>
        Modern open source is characterized by the collaboration
        of <em>many</em> disparate people:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "We as people come together; we have some communal interest.
        As such, we build a structure together that allows us to work
        together, allows us to communicate, allows us to bring in new people,
        and build software together.
        This is definitely not the fastest way to build software, but
        it's a remarkably sustainable way."<sup><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup>

        So what makes it all tick?
        In this exciting conclusion, we'll pick apart the
        key components of the open-source ecosystem,
        from the motivations of contributors to the leadership
        style necessarily implied by them.

<div class="content" id="what-is">
    <h2>What is GNU/Linux?</h2>

    <p>
        GNU/Linux can be likened to a 500-piece puzzle with 2500 
        available pieces:
        For any piece of the puzzle&mdash; shell, desktop environment,
        web browser, right down to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library#Implementations">C libraries</a> and
        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel">kernels</a>&mdash;
        there are around five competent options to choose from.
        GNU/Linux, then, is not an operating system so much as a class
        of operating systems, based around some variant of the Linux kernel and 
        GNU core utilities.  
    </p>

    <p>
        These pieces were not created overnight, 
        but rather through refinement and elaboration over time.
        Moreover, the modularity that exists through the "package" concept
        was neither planned nor intentional, but emerged
        as GNU/Linux came into its own.
        The result, ultimately, is a highly decentralized 
        development effort, without need of managers or oversight.
    </p>

        
    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            According to open-source canon,
            every user is a potential developer.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The package, and in turn, the project, is a central organizing
        feature of GNU/Linux.
        It has allowed individuals to find relevant authorities, to
        promote their modifications to the part, and to craft
        new components as they see fit.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the remarkable things about GNU/Linux is that no one person
        is responsible for the production of an entire operating system.
        Rather, collecting and assembling the pieces <em>is a project of
        its own,</em> distinct from, say, shell development.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="intrinsic-value">
    <h2>Intrinsic Value</h2>

    <p>
        Compared to the market economy we all know and love, 
        open source is a strange beast:
        Its works are created because what they 
        are <em>is</em> what their creators want.
        Stated another way, the intent of free software is 
        the software itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        Such goods, produced for their own sake, are said
        to be <em>intrinsically motivated,</em> and 
        this, in turn, underpins open-source.
        Intrinsic motivation is found in many places, 
        such as academic research and art on public display;
        it's the reason you take out the trash, work out, or plant flowers.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Stated more plainly, we are not in the business of 
            pleasing other people. 
            We are in the <em>"I have an itch and I'm gonna scratch 
            it,"</em> business.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Contributing is not necessarily altruism.
        Rather, the typical story is that a bug is found or a feature 
        is desired, then the modification is carried out and submitted.
        These modifications accrue, and projects evolve to become
        whole and polished. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Projects sometimes attract commercial interests. 
        <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/824855/">Facebook taking part</a> 
        in the development of Linux's new
        <code><a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">btrfs</a></code> 
        is one such example.
        However, in this case, as in all other cases, 
        the principal interest is in the software <em>per se:</em>
        It is developed to be used, not to be sold, and is therefore
        developed for its intrinsic value.
    </p>

    <p>
        If intrinsic value were indeed the principle motivating force
        of the open-source ecosystem, 
        it would follow that those projects with
        the greatest number of use-cases garner the greatest support.
        In support of this, note that the largest free-software organization to date
        is neither GNU nor Linux, but the 
        <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache Foundation</a>, 
        whose projects underpin the world wide web.

    <h2>Anatomy of a Project</h2>

    <p>
        Open-source projects are typically organized around
        a small group of maintainers&mdash; often, only one or two. 
        Maintainers present their project to the world, 
        offer new versions as they become mature, and
        have the ability to modify the work
        however they want.
        They accept user-born modifications as they see fit,
        and they can decline a proposed modification for any 
        reason whatsoever. 
    </p>

    <p>
        With a common, shared goal, the contributors of a project 
        form a community.
        Dr. Brett Cannon explains:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "What is the purpose of an open-source project/community?
        Collaborate together as a group to maintain the project
        and honestly to also have fun.  [...]
        We want to keep the project going for various reasons,
        but you want to enjoy yourself while you do it. 
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Especially about popular projects, 
        leadership can become a matter of curating modifications.
        Very large projects, like the Linux kernel or the Firefox
        web browser, have been broken down into subsystems, 
        with each subsystem having maintainer(s) of their own.
        The result is a tree, and user-born 
        modifications first
        pass through the appropriate subsystem maintainer 
        before being proposed to the project's overarching maintainer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maintainers work diligently over years to present a
        polished product, and have earned the trust of the community.
        They are the most important people of open-source.
        An open source software project without a maintainer 
        has effectively been abandoned&mdash;
        or it is looking for a maintainer :) .

    <h4>A Success Story</h4>

    <p>
        A paging utility is a program that displays a file on 
        a terminal one screenful at a time.
        The first widely used paging utility was <code>more</code>, written by
        Dan Halbert as a graduate student at UC Berkeley in 1978.<sup><a href="https://danhalbert.org/more.html">[3]</a></sup>
        <code>more</code> is a simple program: It first 
        fills up the screen, then waits for user input to print the 
        next line(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1983, Mark Nudelman was a software developer working for a
        company called Integrated Office Systems. From the <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#history"><code>less</code> FAQ</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Some of our software ran on a Unix system and produced enormous log files
        of its transactions. We wanted to be able to search these log files for
        error messages. But the version of "vi" we were using couldn't handle
        files larger than a certain size, and our log files often exceeded that
        size. So we were forced to use "more" to view the files. The problem was,
        once we found an error message, what we really wanted to see was the
        transactions leading up to the error; that is, the lines in the log file
        immediately before the error message. But more didn't allow backward
        movement in the file.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        We often complained about this problem. We said we needed a "backwards
        more"; someone (it wasn't me, but unfortunately I don't remember who
        it was) coined the name "less" as a joke on the concept of a "backwards
        more". It didn't seem to me that it would be too difficult to write a
        simple pager that would allow forward and backward movement.
        I wrote the first version in late 1983 and we began using it internally.
        I continued to enhance it and finally decided it was a useful enough
        tool that I should make it available to the world. I posted the first
        version to the newsgroup called (at that time) net.sources in May, 1985.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Making the program publicly available allowed an enormous number of
        people to use it. Many people have made their own modifications and
        donated them to me for incorporation into the official version, and
        many more have reported bugs they've found or made suggestions about
        features they'd like to see added. This was my first experience with
        the concept of what is now called "open source" or "free software",
        and it has, I believe, produced a very high quality product. I'd like
        to thank all the users of less for their invaluable comments and
        suggestions over the years. 
        Less wouldn't be what it is today without you.
    </blockquote>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Closing Remarks:</h2>
    <h4>Do One Thing</h4>

    <p>
        The golden rule of open source is that those who do the work get to make the decisions.
        As a user, you are free to copy, imitate, remix, transform, debug or rebuild anything in the open-source realm.
        You are also free to create anything your heart desires;
        GNU/Linux is a wonderful platform to support your work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Open collaboration is not restricted to software;
        probably the most ubiquitous example of mass collaboration
        is Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
        Another example is the 3D Printing / Maker community,
        which has produced an ecosystem analogous to open-source.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within open-source, though, those projects that have become 
        commonplace are maintained by individuals with relatively narrow foci.  
        Be it a kernel, a paging utility or the next 
        <code>grep</code> replacement, the trick to mainstream adoptation
        is to do one thing and to do it well.
    </p>

    <p>
        Speaking from experience, the gap between something that works
        and a polished, finished, final product is large, 
        and can take years to span.
        To span that gap, it helps if your project is deeply motivating to you&mdash;
        that is to say, it, in itself, is something that you want.
    </p>
